a one - of - a - kind @entity1 fighter plane brought back to life a century after a painstaking reconstruction is up and running in time for its centenary . the @entity5 - of which only three prototypes were built - was created as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity10 . the aircraft was designed to be launched from platforms on battleships , cruisers and even torpedo boats . ready for take off : the @entity5 - a @entity1 prototype plane - will take to the skies again this weekend after being rebuilt by a team of 60 volunteers at the @entity20 ready to go : the plane was fired up for the first time today and taken out of the hangar before it flies again this weekend 100 years after the outbreak of the @entity1 gunner : aircraft engineer @entity25 points the firearm on the front of the plane . it was designed to shoot down @entity10 now the replica has been made by an army of 60 volunteers who worked from faded plans and two photographs . built with an original wooden frame covered in linen , and using a mixture of specifically - made and re-used materials , the aircraft has been brought back to life at the @entity20 . and today the engine was turned on for the first time as the plane took a turn at @entity44 , @entity45 . @entity46 , manager of the @entity20 , said : ' it went really well . we rolled it out of the hangar and then the engine coughed into life . ' it 's been four years of hard work by our volunteers , a long struggle in the workshop . obviously we were working from old plans , and a lot of the parts have been tricky , we 've had to have things specially made and other bits re-used from existing items . rebuilt : the replica @entity65 which has been brought back to life a century after the prototype was made flying again : with an original wooden frame covered in linen , and using a mixture of specifically - made and re-used materials , the aircraft has been brought back to life at the @entity20 ' but it 's been worth it , to see the plane running was wonderful . worth all the hard work . ' i 'm especially glad we got it up and running in time for the 100th anniversary of @entity1 particularly now that the public are starting to appreciate how brave the men were 100 years ago . ' he added that the plane was designed in the earliest days of aviation - more than a decade before @entity87 became the first man to cross the @entity89 in 1927 . mr @entity46 added : ' the aircrafts were only a decade old , they were still being invented as people were risking their lives and going up in them . ' over 9,500 pilots were killed in @entity1 , and it 's only right that we should be remembering them as brave and courageous - so i 'm glad we 've been able to show the kitten this year . ' the original design only made allowance for a 45 horsepower engine . the framework of the remade one - seater aircraft was crafted in the 1980s , but after the wooden skeleton was completed , work halted . back to life : volunteers @entity106 ( left ) and @entity107 ( right ) pose with a replica of the @entity5 prototype . the aircraft has been built using an original wooden frame and the engine of a @entity113 framework : around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the @entity20 , working from only two photographs and faded plans . above , the reproduction 's original wooden framework powering up : mr @entity107 works on the plane 's 500cc twin - opposed engine , featuring twin - opposed cylinders armed : mr @entity106 poses with the aircraft 's @entity127 gun , which was mounted on to the aircraft 's top wing weights take - off weight - 266kg empty weight - 154kg dimensions @entity134 - 19ft 12in length - 16ft 7in height - 5ft 2in wing area - 106.02 sq ft performance maximum speed - 94mph it was taken up again four years ago by volunteers at the museum , working from the faded @entity142 plan and two photographs . it was constructed with specifically made materials such as the engine cowlings , and reused materials , such as the twin - opposed engine , sourced from a @entity113 unit with similar twin opposed cylinders , stripped down to make it light and take unnecessary parts such as the cooling fans and starter motor . the propeller was acquired from one of the museum 's local flying clubs . instruments inside the cockpit came from the national collection archives . and the seating and padding around the controls have all been made with leather . a gun , which fits on top of the aircraft , was also made to measure . plans : one of the original pictures of the 1917 @entity5 that the team of volunteers were working from mr @entity46 said : ' it was to be a disposable , one - operation aircraft , to simply go up , intercept and shoot down the airship , then ditch in the sea . ' when you work on it , you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect , somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine , shoot at the huge airship , then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could . ' but there were people willing to do it , some very gutsy people . ' in total , the aircraft cost around Â£ 10,000 to restore . the prototype made its first flight on september 1 , 1917 but further alterations were needed - and by the time it was finally airworthy , the threat from airships had receded . prototype : the @entity5 , featuring a 45 horsepower engine , made its first flight in september 1917 fighter plane : it was designed as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity10 . however , the one - seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production historic : volunteers used instruments from the national collection archives for the replica 's cockpit ( pictured ) prepared to fire : the @entity127 gun ( pictured ) was a key feature of the original @entity1 fighter plane four years ' work : the replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum 's @entity223 shows on april 6
