@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) amid growing scrutiny over whether a 73 - year - old volunteer deputy who killed a suspect during a sting operation was qualified to be policing the streets , a new report raises a troubling allegation 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 some supervisors at the @entity13 were told to forge reserve deputy @entity15 ' training records , and three who refused were reassigned to less desirable duties , the @entity11 newspaper reported 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 claims that the volunteer deputy 's records had been falsified emerged " almost immediately " from multiple sources after @entity15 killed @entity23 on april 2 , reporter @entity18 said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 @entity15 claims he meant to use his taser but accidentally fired his handgun at @entity23 instead 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 the newspaper 's story does not say who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 but the orders apparently started years ago , before @entity23 ' death , " back when ( @entity15 ) was trying to get on as a deputy , " reporter @entity31 told @entity3 's " @entity35 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " the sheriff 's office denied the allegations in the @entity11 's report 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 it also declined a @entity3 interview to respond to the claims 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 in an email to @entity3 , the department 's maj	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 @entity42 said the lack of named sources in the newspaper 's report leaves him dubious 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " just keep in mind that the @entity11 reporter can not validate her sources and claims anonymity , which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive , " @entity42 wrote 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 @entity55 , an attorney who represents @entity15 , said the accusations are based on an affidavit from a former @entity13 employee who 's now facing a first - degree murder charge 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " i do n't put a lot of stock in that report or the credibility of who would further that report , " @entity55 said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 shooting casts spotlight on volunteer police programs sheriff @entity69 and other sheriff 's officials have repeatedly insisted @entity15 was properly trained 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 the @entity72 has released a summary of @entity15 ' training courses only over the past seven years 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 the office rejected @entity3 's request for the full training records because @entity15 ' case is under investigation 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 @entity31 said she 's run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who 'd signed off on @entity15 ' training records 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " you would think the @entity13 , if in fact there has been no pressure applied , no falsification of records , that they would be forthcoming with these documents , " she told @entity3 's " @entity35 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " " we 've asked for them 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 they 've said they do n't believe they 're public records 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " @entity15 was classified as an advanced reserve deputy for the @entity13 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 that means he would have had to complete 480 hours of the field training officer program to maintain that classification , the paper said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 @entity15 would also have needed firearms certification training 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 but the sheriff himself has acknowledged there is a problem with @entity15 ' gun certification records -- his office ca n't find them 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " @entity111 went out and qualified with three different weapons with an instructor , " @entity69 told @entity110 radio this week 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 he said @entity15 " qualified with a young lady that was a firearms instructor 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " but she is no longer there 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " she has left the @entity13 and is now a @entity119 agent , " @entity69 told @entity110 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " and we 're trying to get a hold of her and talk to her about 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 we ca n't find the records that she supposedly turned in 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 so we 're going to talk to her and find out if for sure he did qualify with those 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " opinion : who gave this reserve cop a gun 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 even before the @entity11 story , inconsistencies were apparent in @entity15 ' history with the @entity13 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 in his statement to investigators , @entity15 said he " became an advanced @entity138 in 2007 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " but the @entity72 has said @entity15 had been a reserve deputy since 2008 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 it also said @entity15 had undergone 300 hours of training 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 that would be less than the 480 hours of field training that the @entity11 said is required to be an " advanced " reserve deputy , which @entity15 claimed to be 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 in a statement he made to investigators after the shooting , @entity15 said the gun he used was his personal weapon , adding that he last qualified at the range in autumn 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 he also said he 'd attended " numerous schools and seminars related to drug investigations and the tactical operations associated with the apprehension of suspects involved in drug trafficking , " a five - day homicide investigation school in @entity151 and training from @entity154 's @entity153 on responding to active shooters 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 but an @entity154 official told @entity164 never trained with the agency 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " he did n't come to @entity154 , " the official from the @entity153 said , " and he certainly did n't train with us 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " @entity55 said that line in @entity15 ' statement was referring to a lecture given at a seminar in @entity172 by @entity174 sheriff @entity173 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 the seminar was part of extensive training @entity15 received at classes across the country and through work in the field , he said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " he met every training regimen , " @entity55 said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " he met every requirement , and all he did was give of himself 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " @entity15 is now charged with second - degree manslaughter for @entity23 ' death 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 he turned himself in to authorities tuesday and immediately posted bail of $ 25,000 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 his attorney has said he 's not guilty , calling the death an " excusable homicide 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " the lawyer for @entity23 ' family claims @entity15 was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff -- an accusation officials deny , saying they stand by his training record 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them

 @entity202 , who has been brought in to review the case , has said @entity15 fell " victim " to something called " slip and capture , " a term to describe a high - stress situation in which a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 it 's a controversial claim that has n't convinced critics of the department , and calls for an independent investigation into the @entity13 and the case are growing 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 earlier this week , the office spokesman rejected any idea of outside investigators into the shooting 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " we 're not scared to prosecute our own 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 there 's nobody in this culture that can be tougher on cops than their own , " @entity42 said 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " you know that analogy that you 'll eat your young 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 you know , that 's the same thing in law enforcement 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 if we have a dirty cop in our ranks , we will disclose them much quicker than the media 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
 " a spokesman for @entity2 attorney general @entity239 said his office is concerned about allegations reported in the media about the case " and will continue to monitor and assess what appropriate measures , if any , are warranted 	@placeholder in @entity154 says @entity15 never trained with them
