@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 on thursday launched its first space laboratory module , marking another step upward for its space program 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " we must soberly recognize that @entity2 's space - station technology is still in its initial stage , compared to those of the @entity13 and @entity14 , " said a commentary from the state - run @entity7 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " but the launch of @entity16 is the beginning of @entity2 's efforts to narrow the gap 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " @entity2 - watchers agree 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " the test reflects @entity2 's technological advances , funded by its rapid economic growth and facilitated by the military 's ballistic missile program , " says @entity21 , associate professor at the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 the unmanned space - lab is an 8 - ton module named @entity16 , or " @entity30 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " that 's what the @entity2 called outer space in ancient times 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity16 is designed to stay in space for two years and is expected to dock with an unmanned spacecraft in november 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 launches first space docking mission the rendezvous next month will be the true test of the mission , experts say 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " docking is necessary for the development of a space station , which is @entity2 's long - term objective , " says @entity21 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 needs to master this docking technique to be able to build its own manned space station by around 2020 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 it also hopes to send a man to the moon and even explore @entity48 , bringing it in the same league as the @entity13 as a superpower in space 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 for @entity0 , this week 's launch is more than a space mission 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 it is meant to boost national pride and prestige 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " it is no coincidence that the launch of @entity16 occurs just before october 1 , " says @entity22 's @entity21 , referring to @entity2 's @entity57 holiday , when the @entity58 was officially established in 1949 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " i am very proud of our space program , " exudes a visitor at @entity63 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " spending on the space program is very necessary to advance science and technology in our country , " says another 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 also hopes to reap other benefits 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 space missions , experts say , spur technological and scientific breakthroughs in such fields as electronics , computer , engineering , materials and other industries 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 there are military and electronic - intelligence applications too 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 and of course , the economic dividends are lucrative 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 glitch-less space launches are a publicity bonanza for @entity2 's satellite - launch industry , which is already a huge money - making business 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 's modern - day space ambitions date back to 1970 , when it catapulted the country 's first satellite into orbit 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 i remember how over the years the @entity2 proudly spoke of that breakthrough , bragging that the small space module even transmitted the revolutionary tune " @entity97 " as it circled the @entity98 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 but hardly anyone considered @entity2 as a serious player in space exploration 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 over the years , @entity2 has been catching up , pumping enormous sums of money and resources into research and training 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " in the early 1990s , president @entity110 gave the go - ahead for a manned space program and the decision set off a tremendous construction boom that was in some ways as impressive as @entity117 's buildup for the @entity119 project in the 1960s , " writes @entity107 in his book " @entity2 's @entity109 " 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 in 2003 , @entity2 's first astronaut , colonel @entity121 , orbited the @entity98 in a @entity2 - made @entity123 capsule before landing to a hero 's welcome 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity121 's voyage into space -- called " taikong " in @entity2 -- gave birth to the new word " taikonaut 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " only @entity2 , @entity14 and the @entity13 have sent men into space 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 in 2004 , i joined a group of journalists visiting the @entity137 , where taikonaut @entity121 and the @entity16 blasted off 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 it was the first time @entity2 officials had allowed international journalists into the sprawling top - secret launch center 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 's equivalent of @entity143 is an unpretentious cluster of white buildings and towers , tucked in northwestern @entity2 's vast @entity148 desert 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 we were forbidden from taking pictures of the command - and - control center but we were shown around the center 's facilities , including the launch towers and silos , an @entity157 - sized swimming pool and the taikonauts ' austere apartments 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 might the @entity2 become the new space leaders of the 21st century 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 they just might 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 is forging ahead to build its own space station , even though the costs would be enormous , while the @entity13 and other space powers have apparently discarded that option 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 is not part of the @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , which currently orbits the @entity98 while space experts and astronauts conduct experiments in a range of fields , from physics to astronomy 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 the @entity167 is a consortium among @entity117 , @entity14 's @entity176 space agency , @entity178 's @entity177 , the @entity179 and the @entity181 @entity180 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 the @entity167 is expected to be phased out in the future 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 @entity2 is now on track to build its own space station 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " this is not to say that @entity2 will never cooperate with others in space , but it would prefer to do so from a position of strength once it has developed a more capable and robust space program , " says @entity22 's @entity21 , who specializes in @entity2 's military affairs 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 should @entity2 's competitors worry about its steady strides 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " the @entity13 should not be too worried , at least not yet , " @entity21 says 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " @entity192 has been likened to the @entity193 conducted by the @entity13 50 years ago 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
 " still , the upward trajectory of @entity2 's space program seems to point in its favor 	@placeholder launches space lab module @entity16 , which means " heavenly palace "
