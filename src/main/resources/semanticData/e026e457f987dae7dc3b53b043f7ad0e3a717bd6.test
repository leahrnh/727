( @entity0 ) -- politics has returned to the water 's edge 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 in the past week , we 've seen how international events can suddenly dominate a political campaign , at least for a few days 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the uproar in the @entity8 over a @entity10 video that featured anti-islamic messages triggered widespread protests 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 an attack on the @entity15 consulate in @entity16 left four people dead , including @entity15 ambassador @entity18 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 protests in @entity20 were equally intense as some people in a crowd of more than 2,000 scaled the walls of the @entity15 embassy 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 protests spread to 20 other countries in the @entity8 and beyond 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 in @entity28 , protesters destroyed a school run by @entity15 while in @entity31 protesters lit with a torch an effigy of @entity34 , the @entity15 leader once hailed as the president who would repair @entity15 's image in the world , and watched it burn up 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 added to this brew was @entity42 prime minister @entity41 's warning that , in his mind , president @entity34 has refused to be tough enough with @entity44 on its nuclear program and the prospect that @entity42 could take military action against @entity44 on its own 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 world : where @entity34 , @entity49 stand on foreign policy challenges these issues immediately entered into the campaign 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 speaking of the tragedy in @entity16 , president @entity34 reiterated that " we reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 but there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 none 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 " @entity49 , mistakenly interpreting a statement released earlier by the @entity65 in @entity20 , before most of the protests , criticized the administration 's statements as " akin to apology 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 " democrats complained that @entity49 was politicizing this tragedy 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 one of @entity34 's campaign officials , @entity73 , said " we are shocked that , at a time when the @entity15 is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in @entity16 , gov	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity49 would choose to launch a political attack 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 " when foreign policy crises intrude into presidential elections , they have the ability to shake up campaigns and force candidates to adjust their plans 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 sometimes foreign policy can benefit an incumbent 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity90 @entity89 , who was a military hero before becoming president , survived crises overseas in october 1956 and emerged on @entity93 with a decisive victory 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity89 had come under criticism from congressional @entity70 for being so consumed by balancing the budget that he had supported military cuts that they argued would endanger the nation 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 in late october , @entity42 and @entity102 forces attacked @entity20 , which under president @entity103 had taken over the @entity104 and nationalized the @entity102 - owned corporation that managed the area 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 after the attacks on @entity20 , and @entity109 warnings that they would intervene , @entity89 worked hard in public and behind - the - scenes to defuse the situation and force @entity102 , @entity113 and @entity42 to back down 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the other crisis , which also took place in late october and early november , was when the @entity109 proceeded to crush a rebellion in @entity117 against the communist regime 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity89 decided not to respond , fearing that @entity15 interference could trigger a nuclear war 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity70 argued that the refusal to respond revealed that all the talk by conservatives about liberating @entity125 people was false 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 in @entity127 , @entity89 's opponent , @entity126 , warned that " whatever the provocation , aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 " but these crises only ended up bolstering the image of @entity89 as a strong commander in chief who could coolly guide the nation through crisis 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the president coasted to re-election with 457 electoral votes and 57	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
4 percent of the popular vote 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 but on other occasions , a foreign policy crisis greatly damaged the incumbent 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 in december 1979 , the @entity109 invaded @entity31 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the invasion , which took president @entity144 by surprise , played into the hands of republicans , who were arguing that the @entity147 did n't know how to handle these kinds of situations 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 even though @entity144 responded to the @entity109 by calling for higher levels of defense spending and announcing a buildup of forces in the @entity155 , republicans accused him of doing too little too late 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 with @entity15 hostages already being held in @entity44 , @entity156 and other conservatives pointed to this as more evidence that @entity144 could not be trusted as leader 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the @entity162 said that the " policy of patience " from @entity144 was the " policy of weakness 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 " while this was certainly not the sole issue that handed @entity156 his victory , it played an important role in pushing the electoral map in favor of the @entity90 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 what will happen if the current crises continue or get even worse 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 for president @entity34 the risks are very clear 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 if the situation deteriorates , these hot spots will offer the @entity90 evidence that the president is not an effective leader 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 republicans will argue that this proves all the talk about the successes of his foreign policy record is overblown 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the danger is particularly acute with @entity16 and @entity20 , two countries that have been described as relative success stories in the @entity34 era of foreign policy since autocratic leaders were overthrown 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 these crises will also force the president to devote more attention to working in the @entity196 rather than spending time on the campaign trail 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the risks are also great for @entity49 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the crises could easily benefit @entity34 just as they did @entity89 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 anything having to do with overseas issues takes attention away from the economy , the area where @entity34 is most vulnerable 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 opinion : what if @entity15 stops policing the world 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 as was evident in their convention , @entity70 feel they now have the so - called national security advantage 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the successful drone strikes against @entity209 , as well as the death of @entity211 , have given the @entity147 a foundation from which to say the president is better prepared to handle these challenges 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 @entity49 has not helped his cause , since he made widely publicized mistakes during his trip abroad , such as insulting the @entity102 about how they were handling the @entity219 and making controversial remarks asserting the cultural superiority of the @entity42 over @entity222 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 then during his acceptance speech in @entity224 , @entity49 failed to praise the work of @entity15 troops in @entity31 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 as was the case with @entity89 , foreign policy crises , at least in the short term , can create a rally - around - the - leader effect while raising questions about whether @entity49 is ready for the @entity147 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 if the crises subside , the campaign is likely to shift its focus back to what 's going on @entity237 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 but if not , @entity34 and @entity49 will need to calibrate their responses so that foreign policy does not pose a damaging blow to their campaigns 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 	@entity246 : @placeholder lost ground in 1980 after the surprise @entity109 invasion of @entity31
