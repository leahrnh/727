( @entity0 ) -- " @entity2 , " the wonderfully bloody and lustful series , is back for a second season starting april 1 on @entity4 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @entity7 who is also known by the moniker , " the bastard 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " before he had even graduated from drama school , the @entity11 native won the lead role in the @entity15 production of " @entity16 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " calling from @entity18 , the 25 year old actor is unfailingly polite , apologizing profusely for having missed a scheduled time to chat 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity5 also admits ( jokingly ) that he ca n't really consider himself an @entity21 actor because he never appeared in the " @entity23 " series 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " it 's mad is n't it 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " he remarks 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " i kind of wanted to audition for ' @entity23 ' when it was first being done but i think i was a year too old 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " the actor talked to @entity0 about the new season of his hit series ( @entity4 is owned by @entity0 's parent company ) , the dirty business of acting on the show and his swordsmanship 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : what can we expect this season 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity5 : basically you can expect the world we 're in to break apart in a way 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 everything we 've established in this world , this world disintegrates around us 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 but it 's very much in the vein of where we left it 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it gets more brutal i guess , more blood and guts and more sex 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : do n't you love that 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : i do , i think it 's important in a way 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 in our show the sex can be a source of humor 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it can also be more serious than that , it sort of tells the story of how women are treated in the world 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it kind of strikes a balance in that way i think it 's important for shows to show sex 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : are you encouraged to not wash your hair 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : i do n't wash it anyway when i 'm filming 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it 's my choice in a kind of strange little way 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i think when we shot the pilot one of the things that was wrong about it was that everybody looked too clean 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 there was n't enough dirt on people 's faces 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 hair was too slicked back 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 when they saw the pilot they rang and said , " can you grow your hair 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 grow a beard , we want it to look a bit dirtier and grubbier and more visceral 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " we were in @entity98 for about a month and i kind of let it build up 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it was very , very nice to wash it by the end 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : do you also refrain from showering 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : no	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i shower 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : so you 're not really committed to the role 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : ( @entity107 ) yeah possibly 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i can try that next season , although i think people might have complaints 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : do you put dirt under your fingernails 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : yeah we go into hair and makeup and they just shove loads of dirt on you 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : everyone must have reeked back then 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : the sets reek as well 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i remember for season one there was a gutted deer carcass they brought on and this was n't a fake prosthetic deer carcass and by the end of the day it had started to ferment and the smell coming off it was unreal 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 on any day on the set you 've got horse s * * * , oh sorry -- pardon -- and it can be quite a disgraceful place to be 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : your character is called the bastard 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : it 's a weird one that because in the world we set it in it means the same thing but it also means something different 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it 's strange but i quite like it 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : ever been called it in public 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : there have been a couple of times when i 've been called it on the street and i 've said , " hey wait why are you calling me 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " oh that 's right , i see 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : have you become handy with a sword 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : there 's a huge difference between stage fighting and real sword fighting 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i feel comfortable with a sword now , i quite enjoy wielding one 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i would n't profess to be good in a real life and death situation 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 enough to maybe hopefully impress the ladies 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : you were in the @entity18 stage production of " @entity16 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " were you upset that you were n't cast in the movie 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : it was kind of a weird win win situation for me in that i was ramping up for " thrones " when it was being cast , anyway , so i kind of had long hair and a beard and i did n't really look like a young farm boy anymore , but i did go for it and i got a recall 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 for me it was like i 'd done " @entity16 " for a year and if i got the film , great , but at the same time i kind of wanted to move on by that stage 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 so i did n't mind at all when it went no further 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity0 : is your name really kit 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 @entity54 : it 's my name 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 it 's short for @entity184 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i did n't know my name was @entity184 until i was 11 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 i went to school , you do these exams and i put down @entity5 and the teacher said , " that 's not your name , " and i said , " yeah i think i 'd know my own name 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " they were like , " no no your name is @entity184 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 " i was a bit pissed off with my mum 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
 you did n't tell me my name till i was 11 	@entity5 plays @entity6 , the illegitimate son of @placeholder , on @entity4 's " @entity2 "
