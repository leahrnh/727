 many of @entity8 's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 they felt that their party leaders , including president @entity31 , had simply offered a watered - down version of the @entity33 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 yet @entity8 soon learned that extremism could quickly become a political vice , particularly to a party seeking to regain control of the @entity38 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 the right wing of the @entity40 in the early 1960s inhabited a world that included extremist organizations , such as the @entity43 , that railed against communism 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 the @entity43 developed a huge network of local activists , reaching more than 100,000 members 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 they published pamphlets and books and threw their support behind local candidates 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 some mainstream conservative outlets depended on supporters who were in these groups 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 many right - wing organizations in the @entity57 were opponents of civil rights and advocates of racial segregation 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says

 since @entity64 , a @entity23 congressman , was known for his close ties to the right , @entity70 could charge that @entity40 had not balanced their ticket 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 the " @entity75 " advertisement had @entity76 look into the eyeball of a young girl as it reflected the image of a nuclear explosion 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says

 he needs our help 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 " @entity70 certainly had their extremists as well in the 1960s , as all the discussions about @entity99 and the @entity100 in the 2008 campaign reminded us 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 yet in the 1960s , the @entity104 leadership was removed from these elements of the liberal spectrum 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 indeed , radical left - wing activists were primarily revolting against what they saw as the bankrupt leadership of the @entity70 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 they hated @entity62 even more than they hated @entity111 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 always nervous about being tagged by @entity40 in a conservative era as too close to socialism , @entity70 in @entity112 and in the @entity38 since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 now republicans are facing the danger of being associated with extremism once again 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 last week , following the vote on health care , members of @entity112 have were the targets of death threats and vandalism 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 in the final hours of the health care debate , there were reports about how health care opponents uttered racial slurs at @entity104 rep	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 @entity132 , a hero of the civil rights movement , and sexual epithets against rep	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says

 " @entity137 explained later that her use of those words was not about " inciting violence , " but rather about inspiring people to get involved in the political process 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 some ugly elements of the @entity149 movement , which have been held in check since the original @entity152 protest in september , have returned to the political debate 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 in the short - term , the @entity149 movement has helped to revitalize the @entity40 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 without question , the kind of energy that has been fostered by the activists associated with these groups has helped @entity40 mobilize their supporters and can clearly be helpful at bringing out the vote in the midterm elections 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 by generating interest in the libertarian and anti-government arguments of conservatism , the movement will help keep conservatives motivated after their loss on health care 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 it is fair to say that many @entity76 who support this cause are simply expressing legitimate and deeply held antipathies toward @entity152 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 but extremism is there , and it has flared in the past few weeks 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 this kind of rhetoric will not produce long - term gains for the @entity40 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 realizing the threat , @entity5 leaders have begun to disassociate themselves from these elements of the movement 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 there have been a few voices of condemnation , such as @entity38 minority leader @entity186 who said " violence and threats are unacceptable 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 " local @entity149 organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 leaders from the @entity193 @entity149 said in a letter to president @entity195 that they stood in " stark opposition to any person using derogatory characterizations , threats of violence , or disparaging terms toward members of @entity112 or the president 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 " these statements are encouraging and strike the right note 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 yet @entity40 need to follow through by continuing to exert pressure on local organizational leaders to stamp out this kind of activity 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 they must also avoid contradictory messages , such as the statement of @entity212 @entity211 , who accused @entity70 of " fanning the flames " by using the incidents as a " political weapon 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 " @entity211 had a bullet fired at his campaign office after receiving anti-semitic threats , but local police described the bullet as random gunfire not directed at his office 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 the leadership statements must be unambiguous and firm , leaving no question in voters ' minds that this is not what conservatism is about 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 when @entity230 ran for the presidency in 1980 , he worked hard to weaken the connections that existed between @entity40 and the fringes 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 he learned the lessons of 1964 and sought to remake a @entity40 that could appeal to mainstream @entity76 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 @entity230 realized that if he did not , the perception of extremism would pose a long - term threat to the party 's future 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 now republicans are facing the @entity8 threat once again 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 at the same time that conservatives have every right to oppose and challenge president @entity195 's agenda , they must make clear that there are limits and that the kinds of actions that we have seen in recent days are not something that either party will be willing to tolerate in the year ahead 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 	@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @placeholder says
