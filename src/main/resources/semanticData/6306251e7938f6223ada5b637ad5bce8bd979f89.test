( @entity1 ) president @entity0 tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with @entity4 even before he became the @entity6 candidate for president 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 reaching a good , solid agreement with @entity4 is a worthy , desirable goal 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening @entity14 's hand and strengthening @entity4 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity0 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with @entity4 that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the @entity14 and not @entity4 that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though @entity4 is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the reason is that @entity0 has a huge political stake in these negotiations 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the president may insist that the @entity14 will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible @entity46 believe it , particularly in the @entity48 and notably among @entity14 's @entity50 friends , who hold the view that @entity4 is running circles around the @entity14 and outplayed @entity0 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 as the writer @entity54 aptly put it , " @entity4 is having a great @entity0 administration 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " that 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity57 has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes @entity4 has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among @entity4 's @entity63 rivals will do the same 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 in fact , the notion that @entity0 is not handling the @entity4 threat effectively is contributing to a new war in @entity68 , where @entity57 and other @entity50 are trying to push back against gains by @entity4 's allies 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 we can trace it all back to the @entity6 primaries in 2007 , when then - sen	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity0 said he would meet @entity4 's leaders " without preconditions , " leading his rival , @entity77 , to call the idea " irresponsible and frankly naive 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the @entity48 started coming apart , finding a deal with @entity4 started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement @entity0 might leave behind 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after @entity0 's march 31 deadline 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the @entity14 - imposed deadline served only to pressure the @entity14 , and the @entity91 ambassador very publicly decried as a " bad tactic 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " that bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 again , a solid agreement that ensures @entity4 will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 but the agreement so far does not look promising 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what @entity0 had vowed 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 in a presidential debate in 2012 , @entity0 described a crystal clear goal for negotiations 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it 's very straightforward 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " nobody is talking about @entity4 ending its nuclear program 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 not even close 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity4 will be allowed to keep one - third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 that 's not a small symbolic number 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although @entity120 will contain no nuclear materials 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity4 has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the fact is that @entity4 has a well - established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to @entity127 inspectors 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 and the @entity127 agency chief says that has not stopped 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 a couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , @entity127 nuclear chief @entity129 said @entity4 is still stonewalling 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 " we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in @entity4 is [ for a ] peaceful purpose , " he warned 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the negotiations ' starting point is that @entity4 would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the world only learned about @entity4 's secret facilities at @entity143 and @entity144 after dissidents raised the alarm 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity4 , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it is well - established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it is well - established that many of @entity4 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the @entity14 - led international dealings with @entity4 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it is well - established that @entity4 has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring @entity4 to the negotiating table 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it was @entity4 that had the most to lose from a failure of talks 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 but political considerations turned the @entity14 into the supplicant 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity4 officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a " breakout " period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 even the @entity183 facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though " converted " to a nuclear " research facility " and without nuclear material on site 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving @entity4 much of what it wanted 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 with @entity4 forces gaining ground in @entity50 lands and @entity4 commanders declaring the destruction of @entity202 " nonnegotiable " and threatening @entity57 , this deal does not look reassuring 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 @entity0 is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 but the deal so far looks like ( another ) win for @entity4 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
 it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the @entity48 	@entity214 : president @entity0 is right to want a deal , but this one gives @placeholder too much
