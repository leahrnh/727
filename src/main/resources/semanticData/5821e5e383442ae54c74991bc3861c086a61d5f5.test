@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 is a problem that is " off the charts historically " and has sent the @entity4 into " uncharted territory " when it comes to putting down the terror group , the @entity10 administration 's point man in the fight recently told @entity1 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 the comments , which @entity14 made in an exclusive interview , were some of the administration 's strongest to date in describing the challenge the @entity4 and its allies face in battling @entity0 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " this is a problem that is off the charts historically , " he said , referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into @entity21 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " just put that into perspective : it 's about twice the number that went into @entity28 in the 1980s over a 10 - year period to fight the @entity30 , and those came really from only a handful of countries 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " he concluded , " we 're in unchartered territory here 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " @entity14 just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in @entity39 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 last week , @entity40 became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against @entity0 over @entity21 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 the @entity4 now lists 62 countries in the coalition 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 as the @entity4 - led coalition has focused attention on @entity47 and @entity21 , @entity0 has expanded its reach to @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 @entity14 did not rule out expanding @entity4 military action beyond @entity47 and @entity21 to combat the increasing regional threat 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , " he said 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " the @entity4 has also been stepping up efforts to involve @entity70 groups in the fight against @entity0 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as @entity70 tribes see @entity75 militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 but @entity14 said that @entity47 prime minister @entity78 is making progress getting @entity70 tribes to support a planned @entity47 offensive against @entity0 in @entity81 in the coming weeks 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 he stressed the importance of working with @entity78 , noting that the @entity47 leader was in @entity81 last week handing out more than 1,000 ak - 47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the @entity47 security forces 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " we are helping to enable and train ( them ) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in @entity81 , " @entity14 said 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " they put out this very perverse , twisted vision , and it 's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world , " he acknowledged 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in @entity21 and @entity47 is that they 're more likely to get killed in @entity47 and @entity21 , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as @entity0 leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female @entity104 fighter in the streets of @entity106 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
 " that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : " the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up 	@entity14 : @entity47 leader making progress with @entity70 tribes in planned @placeholder offensive
