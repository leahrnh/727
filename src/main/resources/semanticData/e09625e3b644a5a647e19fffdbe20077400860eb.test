( @entity0 ) -- should men be routinely screened for prostate cancer 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 this question has been asked ever since the prostate specific antigen test , or @entity5 , became widely available more than two decades ago 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 @entity6 to this question is another question : does prostate cancer screening save lives 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 both questions are hard to answer 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 screening clearly helps find cancer 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 but many of the cancers that are diagnosed and treated do not need to be 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 left alone , they will not harm the patient 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 and some cancers go on to cause death despite treatment 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 the right question really is : does screening find some cancers that need to be cured and can be cured 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 after an exhaustive process , the @entity21 has announced its final recommendation on @entity5 - based prostate cancer screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it finds that the known harms of screening outweigh the potential benefits for men who have no cancer symptoms 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it notes that all screening studies have demonstrated considerable harms associated with screening , but only one major study found evidence that screening saves lives -- and that study has some internal inconsistencies 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it showed screening saves lives in the @entity40 and @entity41 , but not in five other @entity43 countries 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 even the positive parts of that study did not show a considerable increase in lives saved 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 the task force 's methods are notable for their scientific rigor 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 a group of experts in prostate cancer and in evidence appraisal systematically reviewed and reported on all the scientific evidence to date on prostate - cancer screening and treatment 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 the task force , a second group with expertise in preventive medicine and screening , then considered the review and made a preliminary recommendation 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 that recommendation was made available for public comment last fall 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 those comments were then considered before a final recommendation was made 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 although the task force recommends against routine screening , it does recognize that some men will still want to be screened because of family history or other concerns 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 the task force vehemently stresses the necessity of informed consent in such cases : men must be told of the known harms of screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 hopefully its strong statement will cause physicians and screening advocates to be more cautious about encouraging screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 for years , professional organizations , including the @entity85 , the @entity86 , the @entity87 and even the @entity88 , have urged caution and informed decision - making regarding screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 these recommendations have largely been ignored 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 over the past 20 years , many well - meaning people have supported mass screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 celebrities , athletes , politicians and cancer survivors have endorsed screening 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 mass screening is commonly conducted in shopping malls , churches and community centers , at conventions and state fairs and in vans parked in supermarket parking lots 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 news : task force says @entity5 tests do more harm than good hospitals , medical practices , fraternities , politicians , radio and tv stations and even an adult diaper manufacturer have sponsored mass screenings 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 men who attend them are rarely informed of the risks of screening and are often promised unproven benefits 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 these two decades of mass screening are estimated to have caused more than 1 million @entity127 men to receive unnecessary treatment causing numerous common side effects , including radiation - induced bowel injury , urinary incontinence and impotence , and a significant proportion have serious , life - threatening complications 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 @entity136 screening is a lucrative business 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 i am haunted by a conversation i had in the late 1990s with a marketing executive at a major @entity127 hospital who bragged about his " prostate cancer business plan 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 " his hospital conducted free screening at a local mall every september for @entity148 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 he explained that this was not just cheap and effective advertising for his hospital system 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it was also a moneymaker 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 as he explained it , for every 1,000 men over age 50 who were screened at the mall , 145 would have an abnormal screen , and 135 would go to his hospital for evaluation 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 fees collected from them would easily cover the cost of the free screening event 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 about 45 in that group would have cancer ; the rest would be false positives 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 the marketer had figured out how many men would be treated with surgery , radiation , and hormones 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 he had estimates of all the money the center would make from treating all 45 cancer cases 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 he knew how many men would be treated for urinary incontinence , and what his net profit for treating that would be 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 amazingly , he even knew how many of the men would want penile prostheses surgically implanted to treat their impotence 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 i asked him one question : " how many lives will you save if you screen a thousand men 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 " he looked at me as if i were a fool , and said , " do n't you know 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 no one knows if this stuff saves lives 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 i ca n't give you a number on that 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 " he was right 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it would not be until 13 years later , in 2010 , that a clinical trial would finally be published suggesting that screening saves lives -- and that trial has internal inconsistencies making that suggestion suspect 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 indeed , for two decades , mass @entity5 - based prostate cancer screening was done in this country without direct clinical evidence showing that it was beneficial to patients 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 it was , of course , very beneficial to those who offered it 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 while i hope that this new recommendation will put an end to mass screening , i am not optimistic 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 as @entity221 once said , " it is difficult to get a man to understand something , when his salary depends on his not understanding it 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
 " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 	@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
