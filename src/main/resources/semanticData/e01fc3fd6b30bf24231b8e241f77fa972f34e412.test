 @entity21 , @entity22 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " the drugs are coming north , and we 're sending money and guns south , " said @entity21 , chairman of the @entity23 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " as a result , these cartels have gained extraordinary power 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " about 90 percent of guns seized in @entity6 raids are traced back to the @entity18 , according to the federal @entity32 , he said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 about 2,000 firearms cross the border into @entity6 daily , according to the @entity35 , he added 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 the subcommittee held a joint hearing tuesday on the issue with the @entity39 on @entity40 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 the hearing focused on ways the @entity18 can assist @entity6 president @entity44 's efforts to combat drugs and violence 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 in addition , @entity18 communities are seeing an increase in violent crimes related to the @entity6 drug trade 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 2008 , 366 kidnappings for ransom were reported -- more than in any other @entity18 city , @entity21 said , citing federal statistics 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 the vast majority of those , he said , were related to @entity6 drug cartels 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " we 're not winning the battle , " @entity55 attorney general @entity61 told lawmakers 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " the violence that we see in @entity6 is fueled 65 to 70 percent by the trade in one drug : marijuana 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " @entity61 said he believes the @entity18 can do more to remove the profit from such operations , as well as attempt to reduce the demand for the drugs 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 it 's not only border states that are affected , either 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 authorities believe cartels reached 230 @entity18 cities , up from 50 in 2006 , @entity21 said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 in his home state of @entity22 , far from the @entity6 border , he said , cartels are believed operate in three cities : @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 lawmakers and witnesses at the hearing universally applauded @entity44 's efforts to deal with drug violence through actions such as sending troops into @entity13 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " i think he needs every single bit of our support , " said sen	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 @entity92 , @entity93 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 however , the violence has skyrocketed , @entity61 said , with a new and appalling trend : assassinations of police officers , prosecutors and other officials who are combating cartels 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 perhaps even more horrifying , as the violence increases , so does the possibility that innocent citizens will be caught in it , he said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 in at least one instance in @entity54 , criminals making a home invasion had the wrong house , he said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " the casual fallout is going to be significant if we ca n't do something to try to assist @entity6 in stopping it south of the border , " @entity61 said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 efforts by @entity55 authorities to fight the violence include intercepting wire transfer payments to smugglers of drugs and of human beings , @entity61 said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 between 2003 and 2007 , he said , @entity55 seized about $ 17 million in such transfers 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 however , a more comprehensive and regional effort is needed , he said , as the cartels , faced with increasing law enforcement surveillance in one area , will simply take their crimes elsewhere 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 and authorities must target the masterminds and leaders behind the violence , he said : " just arresting and deporting foot soldiers is a waste of critical assets 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " also tuesday , a federal firearms official told the subcommittee there has been a " troubling increase " in the number of hand - grenades seized from @entity6 drug traffickers recently , and that officials are concerned violence involving explosives could spill into @entity18 border towns 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " in the past six months , we have noted a troubling increase in the number of grenades seized from , or used by , drug traffickers , " @entity147 of the @entity32 told the @entity23 subcommittee 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " we are concerned about the possibility of explosives - related violence impacting our @entity18 border towns , " he said 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 @entity147 did not give statistics about the number of hand - grenades seized by @entity32 , nor were statistics immediately available from the agency 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 another federal law enforcement official told the subcommittee he does n't expect @entity6 cartels to intentionally target @entity18 officials and interests " in the near term 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " @entity166 of the @entity167 said the @entity167 does not believe " that in the near term the cartels will deliberately target @entity18 government personnel or interests or intentionally target @entity18 civilians in the @entity18 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " but , he added , " defining spillover is a tricky business 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
 " @entity1 homeland security correspondent @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report 	most guns seized in raids traced to @placeholder ; 2,000 cross into @entity6 daily , he says
