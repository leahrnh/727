( @entity0 ) think it 's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 it depends on which airline rewards program you 've chosen , which route you 're flying and when you book your ticket , according to a new @entity11 study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 the magazine collected statistics comparing award - seat availability for the five biggest @entity17 airlines on domestic routes 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 the top performer was @entity20 , which offered the most award tickets , 11	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
9 million , and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
5 % of 103	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
1 million total passenger seats 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 " the high number of award tickets is directly related to @entity20 's unique combination of ' every seat is an @entity30 , ' no blackout dates , points that do n't expire , and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the @entity17 and beyond , making us the largest domestic carrier in the @entity17 , " @entity20 spokesperson @entity25 told @entity0 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 " unlike other carriers , we also do n't charge fees for close - in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 " at the bottom of the list was @entity45 , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest @entity17 airlines : 892,000 one - way passenger tickets , or 4	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available

 ( @entity45 only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 ) many @entity45 customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 by not allowing miles to expire anymore , the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 @entity62 came in second place with 5	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available

 what are the world 's safest airlines 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 remember that award tickets are n't actually free 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that 's earning you miles , and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 so it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by @entity11 flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 while many @entity17 fliers redeemed miles on @entity67 flights from @entity95 to @entity96 , the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $ 100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket , @entity11 says 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 better to use them on @entity67 ' route between @entity100 and @entity96 or @entity62 's route between @entity102 and @entity95 , which are generally more expensive than that @entity95 - @entity96 route , according to @entity11 ' calculations 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 while award - seat availability is important , it may not matter as much as passengers ' overall satisfaction with an airline 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 @entity20 had the highest customer satisfaction score ( 86 ) , followed by @entity45 ( 85 ) , @entity62 ( 70 ) , @entity17 ( 66 ) and @entity65 ( 63 ) 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
 and do n't forget the fees 	@placeholder tops @entity11 ' survey , with the most seats available
