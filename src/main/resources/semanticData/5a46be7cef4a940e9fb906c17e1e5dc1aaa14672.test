( @entity0 ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the @entity4 election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between @entity14 of the @entity15 , @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity20 of the @entity21 , @entity7 of the @entity8 , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , the @entity13 , there really was no clear winner 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity23 for @entity24 , which staged the debate , had @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity20 tied first with 21 % and @entity9 close behind on 20 % 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity26 for @entity27 scored it @entity16 25 , @entity14 24 , @entity20 19 and @entity9 17 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity29 for the @entity30 put @entity9 first with 28 points to 20 for @entity20 , 18 for @entity14 and only 15 for @entity16 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 back in the 1950s , @entity4 politics was simpler : @entity17 and conservatives combined took 97 % of the votes 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 but nowadays they struggle to collect two - thirds of the national vote between them 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 in our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders ' tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties ' supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons : as the incumbent prime minister , @entity14 is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with @entity16 alone in verbal fisticuffs 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 he has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity16 has been given a hard time by the @entity4 media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 but @entity17 's leader is a perfectly capable debater 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 he could only gain from their confrontation 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 as it is , election time media exposure has already seen @entity16 's ratings as a leader improve 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by @entity81 's @entity80 @entity79 , @entity14 proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration , on the number of people employed on zero - hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity16 has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration ; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother @entity94 to get the leader 's job 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the impression so far is that @entity4 's voters do n't much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n't quite trust @entity17 to continue the improvement 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity16 , told by his handlers to look tough , is using the " i " word too much 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity14 is curiously short on passion 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 an oddity of the @entity107 debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity113 of @entity12 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 but @entity9 's high score in the post-debate polls was significant 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 she was sharp and sassy 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the number of seats gained by the @entity118 , currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 @entity121 seats in @entity122 , will be crucial 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 last time @entity17 won 41 of those seats : the more the @entity10 take , the weaker @entity17 's chance of a majority at @entity121 will be 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity16 says he wo n't form a coalition with the @entity10 but it could be difficult for @entity17 to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 if there was a " winner " in the debate it was @entity9 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 back in the 2010 @entity4 election debates the clear victor was @entity18 of the @entity19 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting " i agree with @entity18 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 " by entering a coalition government with @entity14 ( in which the @entity19 ' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery ) , @entity18 surrendered the @entity19 ' previous ability to pick up protest votes 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity18 and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government , notably on student tuition fees 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 % 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 perception is everything 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the @entity163 and even for @entity12 's @entity113 but @entity18 got hardly a mention 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the @entity21 remains the joker in the pack 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the party once dismissed by @entity14 as a collection of " fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists " is a serious threat to the @entity15 -- and @entity17 -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 but @entity21 , more than any of the others , is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 grinning @entity20 's blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 his party wo n't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests , sometimes taking votes off the @entity15 , sometimes off @entity17 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 @entity20 has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 % of @entity197 cases he earned condemnation from other leaders 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 on social media , dominated by the young , that earned him the maximum boo count 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 to " win " a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself , to wrongfoot your opponent , and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 the emphasis has been on sound defense : nobody has yet scored an exciting goal 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
 as the campaign moves on , chances will have to be taken 	no clear winner in opinion polls after first @placeholder election debate between seven party leaders
