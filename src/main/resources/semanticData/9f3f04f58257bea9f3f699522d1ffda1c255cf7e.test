( @entity3 ) a jury of @entity2 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the @entity8 , and the emerging consensus is that @entity2 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head - in - the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the @entity19 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 @entity2 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 the magazine 's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 before the original story , " a rape on @entity31 , " was pulled from the @entity2 website , it registered 2	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 an anonymous undergraduate , given the name " @entity39 , " told @entity2 writer @entity40 she had been invited to a party thrown by @entity43 fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang - raped by seven boys , who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student , a casual acquaintance , who had invited @entity39 to the party 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity , a police investigation , the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 but the story began to unravel almost immediately when @entity61 reporter @entity60 took a closer look , leading @entity2 to back away from the story and request a review by the @entity19 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 that review , which is considerably longer than the original article , reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 @entity2 writer @entity40 never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of @entity39 's friends who allegedly talked with @entity39 immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 and at every step of the way , when @entity39 began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither @entity40 nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade ( including one semester at @entity94 ) , i would agree with colleagues who call @entity2 's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 i 've told students for years : you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 and you should never take a source 's word about important facts without verifying the truth 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 ( there 's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 ) most of all , i tell students , remember that you 're writing about human beings , who are complicated creatures : the good guys are never all that good , and the bad guys usually are n't completely bad 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 people can be mistaken or deceitful , i tell young reporters , they frequently forget and often lie to themselves 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 that does n't make a source useless , but it must make you extra careful 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 unfortunately , the early word from @entity2 is that they 've absorbed none of these lessons 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 publisher @entity127 has apparently decided not to fire , demote or discipline anybody at @entity2 , provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " no one fired at @entity2 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 really 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " wrote @entity3 media critic @entity134 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " what would @entity2 in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably , damaged people 's lives , but punished no one 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " tweeted @entity135 , the @entity136 bureau chief of @entity137 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " @entity2 outsources its investigation to @entity94 and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 ok 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 , " tweeted pundit @entity149 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 worse still , the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle , framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " @entity2 's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story 's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems , " the @entity94 report says 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 and check out this amazing conclusion from @entity166 , the managing editor who presided over the disaster 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 @entity166 told the @entity94 team : " it 's not like i think we need to overhaul our process , and i do n't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 we just have to do what we 've always done and just make sure we do n't make this mistake again 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " that smug attitude pretty much ensures @entity2 's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 at a minimum , they should heed the wise counsel of my friend @entity183 , an executive editor at @entity185 who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the @entity94 j - school 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " when doing big , investigative stories , reporters face many challenges : recalcitrant sources , complex numbers , buried records 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 editors , whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity , are spared most of those hurdles 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 but they face their own internal newsroom challenges , particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story , " @entity183 writes 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " they must keep their star reporters happy , trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative , and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " the problem could be , says @entity183 , that @entity2 had too many chefs in the kitchen , instead of " a single , talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
 " until @entity127 and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring , editing and fact - checking process accordingly -- the @entity2 fiasco will eventually be followed by another , one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming 	@entity94 journalism school team finds major lapses in @entity2 's @placeholder rape story
