( @entity0 ) -- our gun debate continues to revolve around measures to prevent deranged people from using military - style weapons to massacre innocent people 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 this is a worthy goal 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 we should do all we can do , within the limits of our @entity9 , to reduce the number and deadliness of these tragedies 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 but i am increasingly concerned that the debate will never evolve to include deeper sources of gun violence in our country 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 after all , most people killed by guns in the @entity20 are not killed in school massacres by villains carrying ar - 15s 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 they are killed one at a time , and usually by handguns 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 all too often , they die in urban and rural communities in economic distress 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 more people die in gun suicides than gun murders 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 this is the real gun violence epidemic 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 and universal background checks -- as important and necessary as that step is -- will not do much to curb it 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 i had hoped the national debate might expand to include a deeper discussion of what is really happening with gun violence in @entity20 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 so far , it has not 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 the conversation did not change much , even after @entity42 , who marched with her @entity45 classmates in president @entity47 's second inaugural parade , was shot and killed in a park while talking with her friends 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 she was only 15 years old 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 the truth is that her story is tragically common in @entity20 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 and the most disputed ideas out of @entity54 , like an assault weapons ban , would n't do much to change that reality 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 opinion : more gun mayhem , and yet we wait for action what can be done to really reduce the senseless slaughter in schools like @entity64 and on the streets in cities like @entity45 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 should we close the loophole that allows people to buy guns without a basic background check 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 yes 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 get illegal guns off the street 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 yes 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 @entity74 assault weapons 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 of course 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 these things should have been done years ago 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 for the decades of inaction , we can thank the @entity78 , a gun manufacturers ' lobby that has divorced itself from reality 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 should we put armed guards in every school 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 probably not 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 more weapons do not necessarily make us safer 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 and the price for doing so might keep us from measures that are smarter and statistically more effective , like better mental health services and counseling for students on the edge 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 proposals for " armed schools " may help the @entity78 sell more guns , but they do n't address the underlying problems 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 they also risk leaving the rest of us in a perpetual high - fear , low - trust society 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 what could really turn the tide 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 much of the daily violence is linked to economic desperation and despair 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 areas of concentrated poverty continue to be linked to violent crime 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 in @entity45 , the most poverty - stricken neighborhoods have the highest homicide rate 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 studies by the @entity108 , @entity109 , and even the @entity110 note the link between lack of opportunity and violence 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 we should be focused on connecting people , especially young men , to training and employment 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 as i said recently on " @entity122 , " nothing stops a bullet like a job 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 as author and journalist @entity127 told @entity0 , in violent @entity45 neighborhoods , " @entity125 is fiction 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 " @entity78 chief : why we fight for gun rights fixing that by making sure every @entity20 has a chance to climb the ladder to opportunity is a good place to start 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 beyond that , many community programs are having success at creating more peaceful streets 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 for example : in @entity141 , the @entity140 has created a safer neighborhood by working with residents to shut down a troublesome liquor store and connecting families to jobs resources 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 the @entity148 is a successful example of an @entity47 administration program , @entity150 , that has received too little money and too little attention 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 @entity155 's @entity154 program reduces gun violence by providing mediating services and resources for youth to participate in community service programs and job training 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 a university of @entity164 study even found that greening vacant lots in cities helps reduce gun violence 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 these programs and the crying need for jobs should be at the center of any discussion about reducing the horrifying death toll in our nation 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 every child dead is a massacre , whether it happens in unspeakable numbers in a schoolhouse or one by one on the streets of @entity45 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 	@placeholder : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
