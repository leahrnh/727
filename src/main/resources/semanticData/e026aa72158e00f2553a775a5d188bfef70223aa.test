 @entity7 is on the @entity31 , 35 miles north of @entity32 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 among the chief concerns raised by @entity14 and @entity16 is the feasibility of evacuating such a populated area in the event of an emergency 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 currently the @entity4 requires plants to have plans in place to evacuate a 10 - mile radius around their facilities 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 but , pointing out that the @entity4 urged @entity43 within a 50 - mile radius of the damaged @entity22 reactors to leave , @entity14 said that " evacuating 20 million people within a 50 - mile radius of @entity7 would be a near - impossibility 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 " " the bottom line , " said @entity16 after the tour , " i still believe @entity7 should be closed 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 " @entity12 said the visit was a good opportunity to hear firsthand from the representatives about their concerns 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "

 @entity14 and @entity16 have introduced a bill that would require the @entity4 to use the same standards it uses to license new nuclear plants when relicensing older plants , " including evaluating terror threats , seismic risk , population density and evacuation concerns , " @entity14 said 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 @entity16 , who first called for the plant to be closed following the 9/11 terrorist attacks , said , " if this plant were being built today , in 2011 , i can tell you it would not be sited here in @entity0 , @entity1 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 " @entity14 said new data showing that @entity7 is located at two fault lines means the @entity4 should also evaluate whether a seismic event could affect the power supply or cause the spent fuel pools to leak 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 @entity12 said as part of relicensing , the @entity4 looks at the seismic qualifications of plants to ensure that all systems will continue to operate safely 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 a task force of " top - notch experts " at the agency is looking at all the challenges and issues that emerged following the earthquake and tsunami in @entity22 , he said 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
 " i expect that we 'll learn some good lessons , and i expect there will be some changes to our requirements as a result of that , " he said 	@placeholder chairman praises " dialogue "
