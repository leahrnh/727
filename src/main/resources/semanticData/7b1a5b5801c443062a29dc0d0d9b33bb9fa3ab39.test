( @entity2 ) the world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two - year shutdown 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the @entity6 's 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 " operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what @entity13 's here for , " @entity13 director - general @entity22 said on the organization 's website 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 " today , @entity13 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the @entity6 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 " the @entity6 generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles ( more than 10 billion kilometers ) -- the distance from @entity32 to @entity33 and back again 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 at near light - speed , a proton in the @entity6 makes 11,245 circuits per second 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between @entity43 and the @entity45 mountain range 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 the purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the " @entity52 " -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 by replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called the @entity61 of particle physics 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 " but we know that this model is not complete , " dr	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 @entity63 , operations group leader at the @entity6 , told @entity2 in march 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 the burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 the @entity6 could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the @entity52 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 @entity13 says the energies achievable by the @entity6 have only ever been found in nature 	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
 the machine alone costs approximately three billion euros ( about $ 3	the @placeholder ( @entity6 ) begins again after a two - year shutdown
