( @entity0 ) -- he 's known as the " bull dog " in @entity4 's legal circles , and just days in to @entity7 's merciless cross-examination of @entity8 , it 's easy to see why 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 the veteran state prosecutor 's relentless grilling of @entity8 -- on trial for the murder of his girlfriend @entity13 on @entity14 last year -- has riveted people around the world to their tv sets , and has sparked a debate about whether @entity7 's no - holds - barred tactics have crossed the line 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 @entity7 had to wait weeks to take on @entity8 , but has wasted no time since he got the chance late on tuesday 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 at various times @entity7 has called the 27 - year - old a liar , implied that @entity8 was pretending to be too emotional to testify , reduced him to tears , and laughed at him for failing to recall the answer to one of @entity7 's questions as the prosecutor ruthlessly tore into various aspects of his testimony 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 on wednesday @entity7 took the defense by surprise when he played a video , taken just months before @entity13 's death , of @entity8 shooting a watermelon at a firing range with friends and describing the impact as a " zombie - stopper 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " " you know that the same happened to @entity13 's head 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 it exploded , " @entity7 told @entity8 , before showing the court -- and the multitudes around the world watching on live tv -- a grisly photograph of @entity13 's wounded head , her hair soaked in blood and tissue from the impact of the bullet that tore through her skull 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " have a look there , " @entity7 barked , to gasps from the courtroom 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " i know you do n't want to because you do n't want to take responsibility , but it 's time that you look at it 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " @entity8 , sobbing heavily , said , " i 've taken responsibility but i will not look at a picture where i 'm tormented by what i saw and felt that night 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 as i picked @entity13 up my fingers touched her head -- i remember , i do n't have to look at a picture , i was there 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " @entity8 ' family sat appalled at the front of the courtroom 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 the sprinter 's attorney , @entity74 , called @entity7 's tactics an " ambush " and objected 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 and the court adjourned for a recess , leaving a hysterical @entity8 to weep in the dock and shocked journalists and legal observers to debate what they 'd just seen 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " it 's not unusual for an accused to be shown pictures of the deceased 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 although not always in this dramatic manner , " tweeted @entity86 , an eyewitness news reporter in the courtroom 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 other reporters said that june @entity13 , @entity90 's mother , had been warned about the photo and understood why the prosecution believed it needed to be shown 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 did @entity7 overstep the bounds of decency in his interrogation of @entity8 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 @entity0 legal expert @entity97 says that while @entity7 's strategy -- to unnerve the accused and destabilize his version of events -- was valid , showing the world a bloody photo of @entity13 was " unnecessary and gratuitous 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " " @entity7 has a responsibility to protect the dignity of the deceased and the victim 's family , " @entity103 said 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " he could have showed pistorius that photo without having to broadcast it for the whole world to see 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " while @entity103 said most people she spoke to shared that view , others said that @entity7 's ultimate responsibility to the victim and the family is to achieve justice 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 if that 's how the prosecutor thinks he 'll get a conviction , then he 's right to pursue any avenues to get there , the thinking goes 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 @entity7 has infuriated quite a few opposing lawyers over the course of his career , @entity103 says , but he has long had a reputation for being incorruptible and impossible to intimidate 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 when he went after @entity4 police commissioner @entity133 in a corruption case in 2008 , he was arrested in front of his family 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 he spent a few days in jail before being released -- and ultimately put @entity133 behind bars 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 in his spare time , he 's active in @entity4 's amateur wrestling federation as a coach and official 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 @entity7 may be known for being a courtroom bull dog , but is his bark worse than his bite 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 despite his long assault on @entity8 ' testimony , the fact remains that the state has very little evidence to disprove the track star 's version of events that night 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " i think he knows that the state 's case is mostly circumstantial , and it was always going to rely heavily on cross-examining @entity8 , " @entity103 said 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " and while @entity7 's been successful in getting his narrative on the record , he has n't yet been able to get @entity8 to support that narrative 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " in other countries , @entity7 's almost theatrical approach might be able to sway some members of a jury , but @entity4 does n't have jury trials -- and judge @entity167 has already reprimanded @entity7 several times when he stepped over the line in her view 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 @entity171 says she does n't expect the judge 's decision to be affected by the prosecutor 's flair for the dramatic 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " she 's experienced enough to know the various tactics employed by the lawyers on each side , " @entity103 says 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " she will have sat before them in court on many occasions , and she 's well positioned to cut through the white noise 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
 " " still , it 's never wise to get a judge 's back up 	@placeholder shocked courtroom by showing graphic photo of deceased @entity13
