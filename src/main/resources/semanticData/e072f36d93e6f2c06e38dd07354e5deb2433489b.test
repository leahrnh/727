( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 's book tour resembled the roll out of a new brand , and from my standpoint as a marketer , it looked like a big one handled badly 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 if , as many suspect , she is running for president in 2016 , she blew the perfect opportunity to present herself as the new @entity3 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 in her launch moment , she proved to be so inwardly focused on herself , she missed giving people the emotional release they 've been waiting for : to see what 's new with her and to be excited about the possibility of her being in the field again as a candidate 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 two cases in point ; her statement to @entity24 that the @entity25 were " dead broke " upon leaving the @entity26 and her interview with @entity28 suggesting that voters wo n't see her as part of the inequality problem and will gladly accept the @entity25 ' net worth of $ 100m + because they pay " ordinary income taxes 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 " this may just be too tone deaf and move her dangerously close to the edge of voter exasperation 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 @entity38 's big miss is that what could have been a moon shot moment for her brand ( that 's why they 're called " launches " and why advertisers spend millions on the @entity46 ) may fizzle into @entity48 fatigue 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 she is amazingly qualified but risks being a brand failure 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 there are several other indicators of a launch gone awry 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 book sales in the first week were only one sixth of what they were for her earlier , and very successful , memoir 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 commentators from across the spectrum have criticized her public appearances 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 a @entity65 poll released monday seems to show @entity38 's lead over @entity67 drooping in @entity68 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 today , her husband @entity38 even had to step in on her behalf , defending his wife 's response to a query about their wealth 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 but he had to acknowledge the missteps , noting hers was " not the most adept answer to a question 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 " evidence that this book tour needed to relaunch @entity38 can be found in a recent @entity82 / @entity81 survey : 55 % people rate her as competent , but 60 % do n't see her as likable and 62 % do n't regard her as trustworthy 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 that 's a perceptual trend among voters that has n't changed much since 2008 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 the book tour should have been planned to replace the old news about @entity3 , with new , inspiring ways to imagine she could lead 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 by contrast , one of the most successful impresarios of product launches , @entity90 , built them into spectacles 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 he protected the run - up to an announcement like a classified national security secret and then unleashed the event with maximum impact to create brand momentum for @entity102 over time 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 every launch was a new reason to be loyal to @entity102 , an even better argument for me to be in love 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 she , instead , leaves us frustrated with important questions unanswered : will she or wo n't she run 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 does she have the fire 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 does she have a vision for her candidacy 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 why is she doing the tour now , so far ahead of 2016 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 how has she changed 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 does she know that people often ca n't get underneath her thick crust 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 who is she , anyway 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 we watch her still back on her heels after all these years 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 it 's not just the trust and likability issues 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 it 's also calling out the woman - under - scrutiny card with @entity24 : " you know you 're being judged , " she said 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 well , some say , of course you 're being judged , that 's the point of all this 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 it is @entity38 's inward focus that keeps her from connecting and understanding the world in terms other than hers : @entity38 has always been about her 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 her accomplishments , her slights , her victories 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 she has always had a hard time connecting her " her - ness " to us 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 that makes it very hard for her to establish why she 's relevant to our lives 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 she seems to refuse to deal with what voters most want to know : what 's in it for me 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 maybe voters today like more the idea of what @entity38 represents , the first women presidential contender , than who she actually is 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 and her inability to connect with people could create an opening for someone else to come in and steal her thunder as the first woman presidential contender 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 @entity167 , anyone 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 @entity169 professor and researcher @entity168 finds that leaders influence and persuade best when they connect to people first with warmth , followed with competency 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 @entity38 does n't fit into this paradigm at all : she leads with competency and , according to polls like the @entity82 / @entity81 survey , displays little apparent warmth 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 successful launches are all about timing and sustained impact 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 @entity38 should have kept the book tour bottled up until she was ready to declare for president because , down the road , we wo n't believe again that she 's coming out to us as new 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 consumers -- and competitors -- stick to this pattern and rarely give a brand in business a second chance to be new 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 a notable exception is @entity102 , which was veering dangerously close to bankruptcy in 1997 , its stock at a low of $ 6 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 in 2012 , @entity102 's stock price was over $ 700 ( before a recent 7 - for - 1 stock split ) and the company was stronger than ever , standing on the shoulders of many successful launches for the brand over the course of 15 years 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 there are examples of companies that have made old brands successful after numerous attempts that did n't succeed ( @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 ) 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 but it 's hard to find a successful brand that came back after a really bad roll out , proving the point that if you blow it as a brand in a big product launch , you 're really at risk 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 as a brand , @entity38 will always be a rational purchase for voters , not an emotional one 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 like a functional @entity227 that gets you through the snow , is good on gas and always runs , @entity38 's brand has real value 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 but as she learned in 2008 , you have to explain to your friends why a functional @entity227 is better than a glamorous @entity235 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 the good news for @entity38 is that politics , unlike business , can be forgiving 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 after all , she is married to @entity38 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
 even so , she has paid a price for the roll out : she seems less inevitable than two weeks ago 	@entity243 says @placeholder 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
