 but there is as yet little sign that the rebels are being driven back , that the fighting in @entity5 is dying down or that lives there are being saved 	@placeholder favors @entity4 arms embargo
 to the contrary , increasingly more @entity5 appear to be fleeing the country , attempting the dangerous trip in rickety fishing boats across the @entity15 to the @entity16 -- a trip historically made by people fleeing @entity19 rather than the other way around 	@placeholder favors @entity4 arms embargo
 hopes for stability , not only in @entity5 but in the @entity23 in general , are fading as fears grow that @entity1 and @entity25 are fighting a proxy war in @entity5 for regional domination 	@placeholder favors @entity4 arms embargo
 and the number of dead continues to mount 	@placeholder favors @entity4 arms embargo
 @entity5 's health ministry said over the weekend that 385 civilians had been killed and 342 others had been wounded 	@placeholder favors @entity4 arms embargo
