( @entity1 ) in case you needed a reminder that president @entity5 is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only @entity7 , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of @entity10 voters 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?

 @entity23 has publicly criticized so - called " fast track " trade authority that would allow the @entity25 to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the @entity32 , which is modeled on the @entity33 , and has killed 700,000 @entity35 jobs and drove wages down in the @entity35 while simultaneously decimating @entity38 agriculture and small businesses 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 aspects of the @entity32 deal would provide incentives for off - shoring jobs to low - wage countries , imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment , and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply do n't like 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 in december , @entity23 wrote a letter signed by several other democrats to @entity35 trade representative @entity55 raising concerns about the @entity32 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 the letter warned that the @entity32 could erode safeguards that have been put in place to " prevent future financial crises 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " " we can not afford a trade deal that undermines the government 's ability to protect the @entity35 economy , " @entity23 wrote 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 at a town hall with @entity68 's @entity67 on tuesday , president @entity5 said , " i love @entity12 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 we 're allies on a whole host of issues 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 but she 's wrong on this 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " @entity5 added , " when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is , when you dig into the facts , they are wrong 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " but " i 'm right and she 's wrong " does n't exactly come off as a thoughtful , let alone respectful , response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the @entity10 today 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 meanwhile , @entity17 is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 @entity88 has recently courted @entity23 's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 but according to a report by @entity94 , @entity88 's staff is at pains to suggest that @entity88 has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 yet it becomes harder to paint @entity88 as the " original @entity12 " each time she equivocates on trade policy and the @entity32 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 in a 2012 speech as secretary of state , @entity88 praised the @entity32 as " the gold standard in trade agreements to open free , transparent , fair trade , the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " but now , as she campaigns for president facing a @entity10 electorate divided over the deal , @entity88 is sounding more critical 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security , " @entity88 said this week 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 so does @entity88 support the @entity32 deal or not 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 campaigning in @entity121 on tuesday , @entity88 reportedly declined to say one way or the other 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 that 's not the behavior of a fierce populist 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 it 's more indicative of the sort of politically calculated , ideologically centrist " triangulation " for which her husband was famous 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 seizing on @entity88 's ambiguity , her potential challenger in the @entity10 primary , @entity135 , released a video this week making clear that he is against the @entity32 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?

 even most @entity7 in this poll supported the position that the @entity35 should either " renegotiate " or " leave " @entity33 versus " continue to be a member 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " in other words , any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding @entity33 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 while it 's not surprising that @entity7 are siding with big business and against working @entity35 in supporting the @entity32 , it 's befuddling that president @entity5 supports it 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 the only hope now is for 2016 @entity10 candidates , especially @entity88 at this point , to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is , for the most part , on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 senate majority leader @entity167 minced no words in revealing his position about trade " fast track " authority : " i 'm not only no , i 'm hell no	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
 " if @entity17 wants to prove she 's a real populist , now 's her chance to be even more clear 	@entity180 : why does president @entity5 call her wrong , and why is @placeholder equivocating ?
