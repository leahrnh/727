( @entity1 ) back in 1989 , @entity0 famously said he was " drinking poison " when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight - year - old war with @entity5 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 the war had helped define @entity0 's regime , the @entity8 , which he had founded a year before @entity9 invaded @entity10 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity0 galvanized the nation , both his supporters and growing opponents , to fight against the enemy 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 he dragged out the war for eight years , despite @entity9 's willingness to accept a ceasefire , and thus stabilized the foundations of the @entity8 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 by the time he ended the war , the economy was in shambles , and there was no sign of his die - hard volunteers 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 since then , " drinking a chalice of poison " has became part of @entity10 political lexicon , and many analysts have asked whether ayatollah @entity28 , @entity0 's successor , would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the @entity31 to end @entity10 's nuclear program 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 like the war , @entity10 's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined @entity28 's era 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 he has defied the @entity31 in the face of increasing economic pressure 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity10 claims that its program is peaceful , but @entity28 's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 the standoff with the @entity31 has stretched longer than the war 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 the agreement reached in @entity52 , @entity53 , however , marks a new chapter in the history of the country 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 if @entity10 can finalize a deal by june with the @entity58 and its p5 +1 partners , international investors , including @entity58 , would be able to invest in @entity10 for the first time in decades 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity10 can develop its gas and oil fields , and the economy can leap forward 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 desperate for a deal , whoever i called over the past week inside @entity10 was glued to their television sets , and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late thursday night 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity10 's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the @entity75 , the @entity10 currency , plunged to one - third of the @entity58 dollar 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary @entity10 were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 millions of @entity10 are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 despite the regime 's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people , critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity91 , a former member of parliament , denounced the program last year and said it had been " against national interests 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 " another critic , @entity96 , said in december " the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 " @entity10 politicians are divided between moderates -- led by president @entity102 , who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners , who view the deal as a threat to the regime 's ideology 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 the majority of people brought @entity102 to power in 2012 , hoping that he would ease the sanctions 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 yet the @entity52 agreement would not have been possible without the moderates ' will and @entity28 's approval 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity28 is 76 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 last year , he underwent a long prostate surgery , which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 his predecessor ended the war a year before his death 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 whether @entity28 is seriously ill or not , many believe that because of his advanced age , he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 so far , the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 during 18 months of negotiations , the regime appeared determined not to succumb to @entity135 demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 the @entity52 agreement allows @entity10 to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 @entity28 can claim that @entity10 is the winner in the country 's decade - long confrontation with the @entity31 -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 he has not drunk the poison yet , not until june , when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
 but perhaps he has raised the chalice 	@entity10 's first @entity149 made a bitter peace with @placeholder 's @entity9
