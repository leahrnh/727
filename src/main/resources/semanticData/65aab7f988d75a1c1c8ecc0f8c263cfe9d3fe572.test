( @entity1 ) the @entity0 has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 a 15 - count indictment filed in federal court in @entity8 bristles with accusations of conspiracies , transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions , violations of the @entity14 , misbranding charges , and money laundering charges 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 who is this menace to society 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 @entity20 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 yes , the courier delivery service 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 wait , can companies even be charged with crimes 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 where would a @entity20 be incarcerated 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 is there a corporate @entity27 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it 's a practice the @entity34 has approved of for over a century 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 in fact , in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 corporations do n't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive , but corporate convictions , on the other hand , turn tidy profits for the @entity48 government , with zero prison overhead 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like @entity20 be held liable for " possessing " what bad guys may send through the service 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the answer , according to @entity20 , is not just " no , " but a " no " so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the company maintains that it is innocent 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it has a point 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 " possession " is an elusive concept 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 when it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket , you " actually " possess those things 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the somewhat hazier concept of " constructive possession " means you can " possess " something without even having it on your person , as long as you have ownership , dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 for example , the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 @entity94 pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway , you " constructively " possessed them 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 conversely , sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle , but not " possess " it either actually or constructively , in the eyes of the law 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home , walk up to your door and hand you a package , completely ignorant about what is inside it 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it 's hard to argue the @entity114 guy intentionally " possessed " your subscription to porno mags , in their nondescript brown packaging 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 that is the idea behind the " common carrier " exception to possession , and a large part of @entity20 's compelling legal argument 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 a " common carrier " is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the public policy reasons behind " common carrier " exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n't function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of @entity94 had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 that would lead to an absurd result 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 that 's why the @entity14 and the @entity152 allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances , so long as it is in the usual course of their business 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 of course , this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves " common carriers 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 " that 's why the " usual course of business " language acts as an additional safety measure 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 in court papers , @entity20 's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from @entity175 to @entity176 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier , since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public , generally 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 on the other hand , @entity20 argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because ( a ) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and ( b ) it offers its services to the public generally 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it 's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 does this mean a @entity199 bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 but if the guy boards the bus with a @entity209 t - shirt and a set of bongos , should n't the driver at least have a hunch 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 that seems dangerously close to profiling 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 is this another illogical straw man argument 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 maybe 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 obviously , the @entity0 disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 according to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the @entity218 , the @entity219 , and members of @entity221 put @entity20 on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the @entity14 , the @entity152 , and numerous state laws 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , @entity20 knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 @entity20 's couriers in @entity233 , @entity234 , and @entity235 expressed safety concerns that were circulated to @entity20 senior management 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the @entity0 is making the argument that even though @entity20 carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , @entity20 knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it raises a larger question , though : why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n't even incarcerate 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : @entity251 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 @entity252 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force @entity20 to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in " deferred prosecution agreements 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 " the reason you do n't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it 's found guilty 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 still , every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 do n't get me wrong : i 'm all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with " @entity289 " in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 i want those guys locked up for sure 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 i 'm just not sure that @entity20 has anything to do with the kingpins of the " @entity296 " email campaign 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 the @entity0 's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it makes good strategic sense 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it might seem like good financial sense in the short run , with the millions in fines extracted from corporations , but that money has to come from somewhere 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it 's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 it probably does n't make good legal sense either 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 yes , we have been treating corporations as fictional " persons " for centuries in some ways -- but it 's silly to treat them as persons in all ways 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
 @entity20 has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon 	@entity332 : @placeholder has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible
