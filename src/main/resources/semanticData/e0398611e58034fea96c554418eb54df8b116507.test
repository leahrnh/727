( @entity0 ) -- are @entity1 beginning to reconsider their vote in the 2008 @entity1 primary 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 with the nation 's economy -- and arguably its politics -- in shambles , it is not very surprising to find in a recent @entity10 poll that 34 % of respondents think it would have been better for the country if @entity14 had n't lost the battle for the @entity1 nomination to @entity17 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 a @entity0 poll released last week put @entity20 's favorability rating at a tremendous 69 % 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 perhaps no one is questioning the 2008 results more than @entity1 politicians who must face the voters next year 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 right now , it looks like president @entity17 , rather than offering coattails to those below him on the ticket , may instead be serving up an anchor 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 this is ironic , when you look back at what actually happened during the @entity1 ' 2008 primary , and at who made @entity17 the party 's nominee 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 it is often assumed that @entity17 used his gifts as an orator and his aspirational rhetoric to energize young and minority voters in a way that allowed him to wrest the nomination from @entity20 , the candidate favored by the @entity1 establishment 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 this is a nice story , but it is not completely true 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 for one thing , @entity20 actually defeated @entity17 in the popular vote 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 still , one has to be careful not to read too much into this , since @entity20 's very narrow lead depends on counting votes from @entity53 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 because @entity53 refused to abide by @entity1 rules when scheduling its primary , @entity17 had pulled his name off that state 's ballot 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 it does not really matter who won the popular vote , however , because the @entity1 does not select its nominee only through a direct election 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 to become the party 's standard - bearer , a candidate must capture the votes of a majority of the more than 4,000 delegates who are selected to attend the party 's national convention 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 although delegates are awarded in part based on the votes that they receive , neither @entity20 nor @entity17 captured enough delegates through their primary and caucus showings to secure the nomination 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 indeed , in 2008 , @entity1 rules made such a feat almost impossible 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 unlike the @entity80 , the @entity1 do n't allow states to award their delegates on a winner - take - all basis 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 this makes it difficult for candidates who are neck - and - neck to pull away from each other in delegate counts 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 adding to this problem is that approximately 20 % of the delegates to the @entity93 are not tied to the results of primary contests 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 party rules stipulate that more than 800 seats at the convention belong to a group defined as " @entity100 and @entity101 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 " these so - called " superdelegates " are not formally pledged to any candidates and attend the convention regardless of primary and caucus results 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 indeed , it appears that the real brilliance of the @entity17 campaign was to realize fairly early that a true majority was not achievable 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 in response to this fact , and having an edge in the early caucus states due to superior grass - roots organizing , the @entity17 campaign subtly changed the understanding of the rules 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 it acted as if the nomination would be determined by the delegate count after the caucuses and primaries , regardless of whether an absolute majority had been achieved 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 what this did was to lower the overall number by more than 800 votes ( the superdelegates ) , and consequently change the threshold of victory 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 since most @entity131 are unfamiliar with how the nominating process works , this was a fairly easy story to sell 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 the press for the most part cooperated 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 once this fiction was accepted , any other result would be seen as undemocratic 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 indeed , @entity20 's complaints about this unofficial after - the - fact rules change were portrayed as a divisive form of sour grapes 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 after all , following sen	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 @entity17 's post-super tuesday february romp through 10 states , it became obvious that sen	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 @entity20 would not be able to win under this new threshold 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 ultimately , and most importantly , the elected and unelected leaders of the @entity1 accepted the @entity17 campaign 's spin 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 this was crucial to @entity17 's success , since a real victory at the convention depended on these superdelegates ignoring the fact that @entity20 was the stronger general election candidate in swing states like @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 in the end , it was the endorsement of these superdelegates -- again , party leaders and elected officials -- that forced @entity20 to concede the nomination 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 the irony of all this should now be clear 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 according to a recent @entity0 poll , only @entity80 @entity166 appears to be in a position to offer a strong challenge to @entity17 in 2012 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 unfortunately for the @entity80 , @entity166 's nomination is anything but certain 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 the results of the 2010 midterms , however , when combined with recent special election results , indicate that , with @entity17 at the top of the ticket , the prospects for many other @entity1 elected officials are rather dismal 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 of course , a lot of these politicians have no one to blame but themselves 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 i suspect , nonetheless , that they are feeling more than a twinge of buyer 's remorse 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 	@placeholder 's favorability rating is now sky - high at 69 % , @entity190 says
