( @entity0 ) -- it all happened so fast 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in january , less than a month after fruit vendor @entity4 lit himself on fire , nationwide protests in @entity3 forced out president @entity8 @entity7 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 one month later , @entity9 experienced its own revolution , and unrest spread across the region to other countries such as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but in the last couple of months , it seems , the rate of change has slowed 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 a stalemate has developed in @entity24 's civil war 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 government leaders are n't budging in @entity14 or @entity16 , and @entity17 's future is still up in the air 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 so what happens next 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 is more change on the way , or have we already seen the peak of what some call the " @entity35 " 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity0 reached out to five experts for opinion and analysis 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 more specifically , we posed the following question : how do you see the " @entity35 " playing out as we move toward the summer months 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity41 : expect regime change in @entity24 , @entity17 @entity41 , a @entity43 specialist who lived in @entity9 for four years , is a political scientist at the @entity45 it is likely that we will see at least two more regime transitions in the next six months 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 one is @entity17 , where the ruling party has agreed to have president ( @entity49 step down 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 it is not clear whether @entity49 is on board with the deal -- if the opposition rejects the portion of the agreement that would protect @entity49 and his family from prosecution , the president 's departure might be delayed 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but it will still be imminent 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity49 enjoys little support both inside and outside of @entity17 , and all parties are growing frustrated with his attempts to drag out the inevitable 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 another is @entity24 , where most think any resolution that keeps ( @entity67 ) @entity66 in power and divides the country is untenable 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity16 is harder to call 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the protesters are unrelenting , but -- unlike in @entity17 -- troop leaders in @entity16 's armed forces are highly committed to @entity49 ( @entity74 ) @entity73 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 their fates are tied to the maintenance of the regime because they are from the same minority @entity79 sect 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity80 also has the ability to initiate a mass crackdown , and the regime 's primary patron , @entity85 , would likely support such a move 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 overall , prospects for consolidated democracies look somewhat bleak 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 prior to the revolutions , a network of civil society groups had developed in @entity9 and @entity3 , cultivating a civic culture that promoted popular engagement and democracy 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but the two countries still struggle to establish democratic systems 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the countries in a possible " second wave " of @entity100 revolutions have even dimmer prospects 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 other than tribes , @entity24 essentially has no civil society , and it has a long - isolated educated class 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity17 has civil society organizations but fewer well - educated individuals or solid state institutions 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 and @entity16 , despite its comparatively well - educated population , has virtually no civil society ; removal of the regime would likely devolve into a civil conflict between @entity79 and majority @entity113 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity116 : ' we are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist ' @entity116 is deputy director of the @entity119 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 one major lesson that @entity3 and @entity9 shared with their fellow @entity100 is that dictatorships do have an end and that they can be abolished sooner than many think 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 furthermore , they inspired the entire region with their success , breaking the barrier of fear and replacing it with a pragmatic optimism that change can be achieved 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 however , the other half of the story that remains is the question of what it takes to effect democratic change in the region 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in particular , it is becoming increasingly obvious that a smooth overthrow of entrenched dictators is quite an elusive goal 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the @entity3 and @entity9 paradigm of regime change in three weeks probably can not be repeated 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in the coming months , a new paradigm for political transition will likely emerge in the @entity100 world 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 we should be prepared to see different means of quelling public unrest in the region 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 possible new scenarios include civil wars , coups , disintegrations , sectarian tension , external intervention , internationalization and negotiated political settlements 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the countries at risk -- particularly @entity24 , @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity14 -- are unlikely to follow one particular path because each one of them has its own set of dynamics and domestic drivers for change 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in @entity3 and @entity9 , we have seen people inspiring others to revolt ; however , in the new paradigm , we are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 it is true the emergence of these new dynamics is likely to make the process of political change longer and more complicated 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but regardless of how long this process takes , the @entity100 public has learned that the time has come for aging dictators to depart -- and that the only option at this point is to move forward with the long - overdue call for freedom and justice 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters

 as the " @entity35 " moves into summer , things are likely to remain hot 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 while it is anyone 's guess what will happen in @entity24 -- consolidation or partition are still equally viable scenarios -- tensions will surely rise in @entity9 as government reforms falter and election preparations ramp up 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 and @entity14 might have quelled the protests in its streets , but it will have done little to address the core sectarian inequalities that are a key driver of its present instability 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 importantly , the bottom - up push for accountability will continue as long as citizens , business groups and other reformers keep the pressure on for emergency laws to be repealed , parliaments to be strengthened and economic reforms to be undertaken 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 particularly with respect to the economy , private creditors and outside agencies such as the @entity223 can play a valuable role in forcing governments in @entity9 and @entity16 to loosen their economic grip faster than entrenched elites would like 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the role of the @entity231 , which includes countries such as @entity233 , @entity234 and the @entity235 , will remain pivotal and come ever more into the spotlight 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 these oil - rich states have been key investors across the @entity100 world and play a vital role in financing the necessary structural economic modernization the region needs 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 remember that the @entity100 world is not the third world -- it has all the money it needs to solve its own problems 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the question is if it can overcome the stale arabism of the past , which affirmed insecure nationalism , in favor of a new arabism that champions trans - @entity100 interdependence 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 @entity253 : odds stacked against @entity16 revolution @entity253 is an assistant professor for the political science department at the @entity257 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the events in @entity3 and @entity9 offer hope that uprisings elsewhere in the @entity43 and @entity261 will meet with success 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 perhaps most striking are the events unfolding in @entity16 , where few predicted mass protests against @entity266 's regime and where the conventional wisdom suggests that past repression , ethnic - religious diversity and relative popularity would shield @entity73 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in many ways , the events in @entity16 draw strong parallels to @entity9 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in the hopes of appeasing protesters , @entity73 offers concessions every few days -- a lifting of the niqab ban , offering citizenship to @entity279 and promising to rescind emergency law 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but much like ( @entity9 president @entity281 ) @entity281 , @entity73 constantly appears to be a step behind the protesters ' demands 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 while the magnitude of @entity16 protests is impressive , the fate of @entity73 's regime remains an open question 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 specifically , a loyal military and the legacy of limited association rights significantly diminish the prospects of a successful revolution in the country 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 in @entity9 , protesters benefited from relatively strong @entity297 ( nongovernmental organizations ) and experience with activism , but @entity16 has a more limited and restricted civil society 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 data from the @entity303 reveal that there are nearly five times more civil society organizations per capita in @entity9 than @entity16 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 except for the @entity309 revolt in 1982 and @entity279 demonstrations in 2004 , political protest in @entity16 has been minimal 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 all of this suggests that @entity16 protesters have less local political experience and knowledge , fewer resources and smaller networks that they can tap into 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 these deficiencies limit protesters ' ability to pressure the regime and ensure it is held accountable for its actions 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters

 " the notion of an " @entity35 " is a misnomer because it assumes that the @entity100 world is a monolith 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 yes , these uprisings are motivated by common political and economic grievances rooted in decades of authoritarian rule 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 and , yes , the protesters aspire to common democratic objectives 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 but each country in the @entity100 world is different 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 each has its own internal story and confronts different obstacles related to class and minority cleavages , the strength of the military and state institutions , and the unity and democratic orientation of the opposition forces 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 moreover , the nature and character of the forms of authoritarian rule in the @entity100 world -- and the devastation they have wrought -- pose different challenges for democrats moving forward 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 there is cause for optimism even if we assume a worst - case scenario where democratic forces are crushed in @entity24 , @entity16 , @entity17 and beyond 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 were this to happen , these revolts would still leave behind a powerful legacy that future democratic forces can build upon , buttressed by the successful of examples of @entity3 and @entity9 , where the prospects for democracy appear to be the greatest 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 regardless of how many democratic transitions we witness this year , the tide of history has turned 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
 the days are numbered for @entity100 authoritarian regimes , and those who argue that @entity380 / @entity100 culture is incompatible with democracy are left scrambling 	the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
