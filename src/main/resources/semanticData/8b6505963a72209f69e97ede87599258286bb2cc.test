( @entity1 ) the public outrage over the " religious freedom " bills recently passed in @entity3 and @entity4 caught the governors of those states completely off - guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 as poll watchers , they surely knew that most @entity10 now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 they had better adjust to a new reality 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in @entity10 's population 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout @entity30 who place more emphasis on @entity33 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law

 and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 hence , after @entity4 gov	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
 @entity54 signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same - sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the @entity60 , the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and even the @entity66 hotel chain 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law

 " asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same - sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same - sex honeymooners , @entity67 pointed to the @entity92 's injunction of unconditional love , but added " beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law

 for media - savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it 	@entity190 : @placeholder , @entity3 governors caught off guard by outrage , boycotts over @entity196 law
