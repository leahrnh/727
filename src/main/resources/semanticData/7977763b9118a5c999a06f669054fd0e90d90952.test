( @entity1 ) as @entity0 mark the 150th anniversary of @entity4 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to @entity9 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity4 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his @entity14 roots 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 he knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 the entire region from the @entity21 to the @entity22 drained through the @entity23 , enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through @entity28 and from there to the world 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 he thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular , or @entity32 more generally 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 the @entity0 landmass , he insisted , " is well adapted to be the home of one national family ; and it is not well adapted for two , or more " because " there is no line , straight or crooked , suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 " @entity4 supplemented his @entity14 geography lesson with a distinctly @entity14 claim about constitutional history : " @entity43 is older than any of the @entity44 ; and in fact , it created them as @entity0 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 " @entity4 did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case , and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the @entity51 's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 the @entity51 is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 but @entity4 's additional assertion that the @entity43 created the states , not vice versa , provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 most virginians , including @entity62 gen	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity61 , insisted that of course @entity63 had come first 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 at the outbreak of the @entity67 , the @entity65 was already a century and a half old 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 generations of @entity70 had helped govern @entity63 long before the @entity0 was born 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 but if @entity61 was , first and always , a @entity63 , @entity4 was an @entity0 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 his father came from @entity63 , his grandfather hailed from @entity73 , and before that , the family had probably lived in @entity76 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity77 himself had been born in @entity79 and had moved as a boy to @entity81 , and later , as a young man , to @entity9 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 these latter two @entity14 states had undeniably been formed by the @entity43 itself 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 these places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all @entity0 -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 when young @entity77 moved to @entity81 , it was just becoming a state , thanks to federal governmental action 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 it was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the @entity100 and countless other @entity101 to leave the @entity79 for a brighter future in the @entity14 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 retracing @entity4 's assassination 150 years later that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 the @entity106 had always been free soil , as provided for by a @entity107 that predated the @entity0 @entity51 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 the words of the 13th amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that @entity4 would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in @entity0 and did so by borrowing verbatim from @entity111 6 of the @entity107 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 true , geography is not inexorable destiny 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 many other midwesterners in @entity4 's era embraced slavery and secession 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity118 , the @entity120 justice who did the most to make @entity4 's constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in @entity124 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 but geographic variation has always been a large part of @entity0 's constitutional saga 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 in the 1860 election that brought him to power , @entity4 swept almost all the @entity131 states , but did miserably in the slaveholding south 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity133 , the dastard who ended @entity4 's life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 so was @entity4 's nemesis on the @entity120 , chief justice @entity140 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity140 's most infamous ruling , the pro-slavery @entity143 decision in 1857 , had emerged from a court dominated by the @entity145 ; although slave states accounted for less a third of @entity0 's free population , this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 remembering @entity4 's murder in our era , given the fact that @entity156 appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern @entity156 on the @entity120 -- most notably , @entity164 's @entity163 , @entity9 ' @entity165 , and @entity166 's @entity162 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 all nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal @entity76 , at @entity170 or @entity171 , and the @entity156 appointee most attentive to gay rights , @entity172 , grew up in northern @entity174 , a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 which takes us back to @entity4 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 when @entity172 was a lad in @entity174 's state capital , the governor , a friend of the @entity172 family , was a @entity4 @entity156 named @entity184 -- a man who would later author the @entity120 's iconic opinion in @entity189 , vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by @entity4 and his allies 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 today , both parties at their best claim @entity4 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity194 aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and @entity198 is a @entity79 who professes interest in racial outreach 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 @entity202 was born an @entity9 @entity156 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 and the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from @entity9 who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating @entity4 's geographic coalition , winning every state within a four - hour drive of @entity212 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
 in the largest sense , then , all @entity0 , of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in @entity9 -- are living in the @entity9 	@entity218 : @entity4 's two biggest legacies , keeping union together and abolishing slavery , had @placeholder roots
