( @entity0 ) -- today , former @entity2 candidate and @entity4 ceo @entity1 announced a new initiative called the @entity6 ( @entity8 ) project , which will organize conservative and @entity10 women in key states to educate and turn out voters 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 according to @entity1 , the @entity13 will engage women at the grassroots level to help conservatives close the gender and technology gap 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 it will utilize cutting - edge technology and techniques to target , persuade and turn out female voters in six key states with competitive 2014 @entity2 races : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 this morning , i spoke with @entity1 about the effort and whether or not she has any future plans to run for office 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity35 : is this a direct response to the @entity38 ' " @entity37 " campaign strategy 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : yes , exactly 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and the idea really came to me when i spoke at @entity42 earlier this year 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 in my speech , i took on the " @entity37 " directly , and the response was overwhelming 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 i heard from so many women saying this is what they needed 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 it can help deliver their messages and provide resources to get them mobilized 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : it sounds like you 're talking about dispatching an army of women to go door - to - door 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 i ca n't decide if that 's a retro approach or a modern one 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : well , i think one of the things that we learned in both the @entity64 campaign and the tea party movement -- so , truly polar opposites -- is that they engaged people on the ground in a very personal manner , with personal outreach 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and that 's what works 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and it particularly works with women 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 they are persuaded by other women they know 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : so , no parachuting in at the last minute , running an ad , and expecting women to turn out 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : no	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 all the data says that people are most persuaded by people they know 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we are going to engage people in the communities where they live and work , train them where they are , and measure the results so we know what 's working 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 that matters a lot 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : so is it old - fashioned grass roots campaigning 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : well , it 's modern in that we 're using technology to train our messengers and broaden our messages 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but the politics of personal relationships still matters the most 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : so @entity38 will merely say , " candidate @entity101 opposes the @entity103 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 candidate @entity101 is against women 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 " it wo n't matter , by the way , if candidate @entity101 is a woman herself 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 how should conservatives combat this 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : i think in some cases we just have to take on the facts 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 there are plenty of laws in place today that a woman can look to if she 's truly discriminated against at work , where she 's actually earning less for the same job as her male counterpart 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 so the @entity103 , the @entity122 -- these are tokens 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 they 're gestures 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 they do n't truly help women advance 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we ca n't avoid the factual arguments , because they 're on our side 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : are women single - issue voters 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : absolutely not 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 of course , there are some people -- men and women -- who truly vote on single issues 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but they are not a majority , and certainly not a majority of women 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 women make up 53 % of the vote , and their views are as broad and diverse as are men 's 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 most women care about jobs and the economy , and the polls bear this out 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and you know , even when the issue is life and choice , most women think that abortion after five months is egregious 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : so what has n't the @entity10 been doing right to target women voters 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : it 's not a question of doing things wrong 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 it 's a question of leaving things out 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 first , all of the ads that run are very helpful , but they 're not as helpful as an effective grassroots plan 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 sometimes we talk at a high level about policies and principles , but we need to bring it down to a personal level 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we talk a lot about less taxes and less regulation -- as principles 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but if you 're a single mom with two kids and you 're trying to open a hair dressing shop , it 's going to take you over a year to deal with all the regulations to do that , and you have a tax code that 's thousands of pages long 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 you might get discouraged 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we 're destroying more businesses than we 're creating in this country 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : do @entity10 male candidates need " sensitivity training " 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : ( @entity185 ) sometimes men know these are sensitive , hot - button issues and so they 're afraid to deal with them 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and some , not many , really do put their foot in their mouth 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 it 's not that women do n't listen to men 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 they do 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but they also listen to other women 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 so it 's less about who 's doing something wrong and more about what 's missing 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we need to be more empathetic and less judgmental 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we need to be more optimistic 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : do @entity10 need to nominate a woman to defeat @entity200 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : i do n't want to say that necessarily 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 if a woman emerges , that 's terrific 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but we ca n't let this ridiculous charge stand 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we just ca n't 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 we have to deal with it head on for 2014 , never mind 2016 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity53 : any plans to run again yourself 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 @entity1 : you never know 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 i never close off any possibility in life 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 and when people encourage you to do it you have to think about it 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
 but right now i 'm focused on the @entity13 and getting candidates elected for 2014 	@entity35 interviews former @entity2 candidate @placeholder about her new initiative
