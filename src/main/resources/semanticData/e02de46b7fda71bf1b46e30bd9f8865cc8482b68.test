@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- before it 's signed , the freshly minted security agreement between the @entity4 and @entity1 must face the scrutiny of the @entity1 people in @entity0 , starting thursday 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 thousands of tribal elders , who have made their way to the capital , have kicked off the loya jirga , a grand assembly , to confer in the coming days on a key issue : whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of @entity4 troops beyond next year , when @entity18 plans to end their combat mission 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " they have to pass it , " said @entity4 secretary of state @entity20 , who announced wednesday that he and @entity1 president @entity21 had arrived at the agreement 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " it 's up to the people of @entity1 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " but is the jirga 's decision binding 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 and what happens next 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 what is the loya jirga 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 a loya jirga is a uniquely @entity1 way of debating and resolving issues of national importance 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 for centuries leaders of the rugged , tribal - based @entity38 nation have called the assembly to choose new kings , debate political matters and factional disputes , or adopt new laws and constitutions 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the meetings are intended to bridge divides between the country 's divergent ethnic groups and create consensus among them 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 is the loya jirga 's decision binding 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 not really 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the loya jirga is by no means fully democratic , but the opinions of its 2,000 - plus members are an important indicator of how the @entity1 people feel 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 in the past , @entity21 has said he respects the body and would acquiesce to its decision 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the elders have come to this loya jirga at @entity21 's invitation , but that does not guarantee that they will support him in approving the security agreement 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 he has been heckled at least once at a past gathering 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 how does the assembly work 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 after the opening session thursday , the jirga will break up into smaller working groups for the next three days 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the members will discuss the agreement among themselves and then present their recommendations to the full gathering 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 if the loya jirga passes the security agreement , what 's next 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 once the elders have weighed in , @entity1 's parliament will vote on the proposed bilateral agreement 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 then it will wait for signature by the president 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 that may not be @entity21 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 on thursday , he told the tribal elders that the arrangement wo n't be signed until after elections scheduled for april 2014 , and @entity21 has reached the term limit set by his country 's constitution 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 he told @entity2 's @entity92 it 's " absolutely time to go 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " if all goes well , when does the agreement go into effect 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the agreement would go into effect january 1 , 2015 , and last " until the end of 2024 and beyond , unless terminated " by mutual agreement , according to a copy of the deal posted online wednesday by the @entity1 government 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 a @entity4 official confirms the copy is authentic 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the agreement says that either side will have to give two years ' notice if they want to terminate it 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 what are the key takeaways in the tentative agreement 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the final language of the security agreement -- which @entity20 and @entity21 reached a deal on -- guides the role of @entity4 troops in @entity1 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 according to the tentative deal : -- @entity4 forces will play a support role in @entity1 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 -- but it also says that @entity4 military operations " may be appropriate " to defeat @entity122 and its affiliates 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 -- it says the @entity1 military will take the lead in counterterrorism operations and the @entity4 will complement that " with full respect for @entity1 sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the @entity1 people , including in their homes 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " -- it mentions @entity4 government funding for @entity1 security forces 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 -- it gives the @entity4 military strict jurisdiction if a @entity4 soldier is alleged to commit unlawful acts on @entity1 soil 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 -- on the other hand , @entity1 authorities may request that anyone be removed from the country 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 so , what are the sticking points 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 military raids and strikes have long been a sore point between the two countries , given a number of incidents in which civilian men , women and children were killed 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the proposed deal contains references to respecting " @entity1 's sovereignty and territorial integrity " and adds that @entity4 forces " shall not target @entity1 civilians , including in their homes 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " but the agreement does not address past transgressions 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 why not 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 because @entity20 says that during his back - and - forth with @entity21 , a demand for a @entity4 apology was " not even on the table 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " some published reports have suggested otherwise 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " i do n't know where the idea of an apology started , " @entity20 said 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " president @entity21 did n't ask for an apology 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 there has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " but the @entity4 has made a promise , @entity21 told the loya jirga thursday 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 president @entity186 has vowed that @entity4 troops wo n't raid @entity1 homes barring exceptional cases involving direct threat to @entity4 citizens 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 in a letter from @entity186 to @entity21 , made public by @entity1 officials , the @entity4 president reiterates that @entity4 forces in @entity1 will " continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of @entity1 in their homes and in their daily lives , just as we do for our own citizens 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " " as this new agreement states , @entity4 forces shall not enter @entity1 homes for the purposes of military operations , except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of @entity4 nationals , " @entity186 wrote 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " the @entity4 commitment to @entity1 's independence , territorial integrity , and national unity , as enshrined in our @entity216 , is enduring , as is our respect for @entity1 sovereignty 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " what 's another stumbling block 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 another stumbling block is whether @entity4 soldiers accused of a crime can stand trial in an @entity1 court 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the agreement gives the @entity4 strict military jurisdiction 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 but many @entity1 feel that that compromises the country 's sovereignty 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 is the issue of immunity a deal - breaker 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the @entity4 has said that unless @entity4 troops get immunity from @entity1 prosecution , it will pull out all its troops by the end of 2014 -- like it did from @entity241 at the end of 2011 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 that could have significant consequences for @entity1 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 it needs some troop presence for training its forces and for stability 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 can this obstacle be resolved 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 @entity21 says he can convince the loya jirga to allow that 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " i can go to the @entity1 people and tell them that , well , if we are to ask for a @entity4 presence in @entity1 for that broader security and stability , there are things that they want in return , " he told @entity92 in january 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " and immunity is the principle thing that they want 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 so i will argue for it 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 and i can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say , all right , let 's do it 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " what 's the takeaway : will all @entity4 troops be home by the end of 2014 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 no	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 president @entity186 has promised to end @entity4 combat mission by the end of 2014 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the key word here is " combat 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " speaking on wednesday , @entity280 spokesman @entity279 stressed that same point : " the war in @entity1 will end next year , as the president has promised 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 the combat mission will be over 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 " but the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for @entity4 troops to remain on the ground in @entity1 beyond that 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 @entity20 said the @entity4 military 's role in @entity1 would be " very limited , " adding " it is entirely ( to ) train , equip and assist " @entity1 forces 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
 @entity2 's @entity296 contributed to this report 	@placeholder says " it 's up to the people of @entity1 " to approve the agreement
