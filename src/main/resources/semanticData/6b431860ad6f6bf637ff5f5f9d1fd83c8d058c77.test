( @entity1 ) @entity0 is unique on the @entity3 calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds @entity8 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 that 's in part because @entity0 is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the @entity3 tradition , actually know about what is called @entity21 and its culmination on @entity24 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 after all , @entity21 calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 why do @entity50 make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of @entity0 weekend 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 there is a phrase that many never come across , even among @entity50 : @entity54 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 this refers to the three days of @entity0 that begin with @entity56 , proceed through @entity57 , and conclude with @entity24 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity54 has a kind of major prologue in @entity65 , the day when , by tradition , @entity66 celebrated the @entity68 with his disciples in the upper room in @entity71 on the night before he was crucified 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 the idea of @entity73 begins with this meal , which was a @entity75 meal 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity66 , of course , was @entity77 , as were all his disciples 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 he was never trying to erase @entity79 and found a new religion 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 his work involved modifying and extending @entity79 in fresh ways 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 on @entity65 , @entity50 sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that @entity66 washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the @entity68 as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity56 is n't , in fact , so good 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's the day of the crucifixion , when @entity66 was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to @entity94 , the " place of the skull , " and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 the actual scene of the @entity102 varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so - called " seven last words " of @entity66 by adding up fragments from different gospels 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 some of these words are quotations , as when @entity66 asked @entity111 why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd @entity113 , which opens : " my @entity111 , my @entity111 , why hast thou forsaken me 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 " @entity56 is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity57 is probably the least understood day of the @entity54 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of @entity0 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 then comes @entity0 , with the aura of the resurrection 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 i 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of @entity137 becomes what is called a " glorified body 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 " this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the @entity141 , although that 's part of it , too 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity144 implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's very important that almost nobody who encounters @entity66 after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity0 embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 the three days of @entity0 , the @entity162 , occur only once a year on the calendar 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it was the @entity172 who famously observed that life is suffering 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity56 embodies the @entity3 version of that truth 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 @entity66 suffered in the way all of us must suffer 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 our friends and families must die 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 this is simply part of the human experience 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 we know well this in - between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 and we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 this is the joy of @entity0 , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's there whenever we experience what @entity204 once called the " timeless moment , " which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 i suspect we all experience the @entity162 frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 but the ritual enactment of these three days of the @entity0 season reminds all of those who practice @entity3 -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
 it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture 	@entity224 : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of @placeholder and @entity0
