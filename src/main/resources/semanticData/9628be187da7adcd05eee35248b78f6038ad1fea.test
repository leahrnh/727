( @entity1 ) recently , @entity0 was in @entity2 , @entity3 , to campaign against @entity4 , which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 in his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening , he decided to compare " vaccine - induced " autism to the @entity10 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 he said , " they get the shot , that night they have a fever of a hundred and three , they go to sleep , and three months later their brain is gone , " @entity0 said 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " this is a holocaust , what this is doing to our country 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " a few days later , he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the @entity10 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 to many , it 's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the @entity29 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 in a statement , @entity0 said , " i want to apologize to all whom i offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 i employed the term during an impromptu speech as i struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism , which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " @entity0 has apologized for the wrong things 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 first and foremost , vaccines do not cause autism 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the two have nothing to do with each other 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 second , he seems to think people with autism are " gone , " their lives " destroyed " and their families " shattered 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " autism is not a death sentence 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 people with autism are not missing or destroyed 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 they are everywhere , trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman , missing or worthless 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity0 's rhetoric is a problem , even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 people who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach - based enemas 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 others , believing autism functions as a death sentence , even kill their children 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 i am worried about the effect of having such a powerful , high - profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 i reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity83 , president of the @entity84 , wrote , " @entity0 , who has engaged with autism only to spread lies , misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric , has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic @entity91 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 while his father , uncle and many others in the @entity96 family championed the rights of people with disabilities , he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " these are harsh words , but try to see the situation through @entity83 's eyes 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 not only is @entity0 perpetuating a discredited theory , but he 's also suggesting that it 's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the usual response to people like @entity83 is that he is " high functioning , " but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity120 , an autistic teenager and writer , is devastated by this focus on burden 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 last year , he wrote a post to other autistic children : " know you are not a burden or trouble for being 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 you are a person who has every right to be 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 a family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the family is wrong 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 not you 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " meanwhile , @entity135 , an autistic activist and blogger , wrote , " i am very disabled , have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions , seizures almost every day , but am happy , proud and accomplished , with the human supports i have 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 that 's what is missing 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 acceptance 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " as children , @entity135 and @entity120 might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as " gone , " by @entity0 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 clearly , both are very much present 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity154 , an autistic writer and editor with @entity156 , wrote , " the neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 it is a way for autistic people , as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology , to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural , less worthy , or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 " i wish @entity0 realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities , even as he defended the sacred status of the @entity10 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 there is , though , one story from the @entity10 that he might do well to consider 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 the first group the @entity29 systematically exterminated , in the infamous @entity185 , were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 thousands of children , adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers , laying the groundwork for the later , larger scale acts of genocide 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity196 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 we fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity , not by fearmongering 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
 @entity0 owes a lot of people another apology 	@entity209 : @placeholder compared autism to the @entity10 , wrongly tied it to vaccines
