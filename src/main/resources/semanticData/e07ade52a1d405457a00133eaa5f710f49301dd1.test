( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 's @entity2 explorer is hurtling through space on its way to the outermost reaches of the solar system for a rendezvous with the small , icy " dwarf planet " of @entity10 and its five moons 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 it 's a staggering decade - long , 3 billion mile journey that started with the @entity2 launch in 2006 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 the space probe is expected to reach @entity10 next summer , the only spacecraft to visit it 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 it 's also only the fifth probe to ever journey so far from the sun across such vast reaches of space , according to @entity3 officials 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 @entity2 is reminiscent of another historic undertaking : @entity3 's @entity25 mission to @entity26 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 monday marks the 25th anniversary of @entity25 's fly - by of @entity26 and its moon @entity29 on august 25 , 1989 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 the mission gave humanity its first close - up glimpse of the eighth planet from the sun and its largest satellite 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 marking the 25th anniversary , @entity3 has released a global color map of @entity29 using @entity25 's extraordinary footage of the moon and a video of the fly - by 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 the space agency says the map 's colors are a close approximation of the moon 's natural colors 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 @entity3 says the image of @entity29 and video provides a sneak peek of what scientists expect when @entity2 reaches @entity10 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 " although @entity29 is a moon of a planet and @entity10 is a dwarf planet , @entity29 serves as a preview of sorts for the upcoming @entity10 encounter , " @entity3 said on its website 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 but the space agency also says it expects great differences in the large moon and the dwarf planet 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 " although both bodies originated in the outer solar system , @entity29 was captured by @entity26 and has undergone a radically different thermal history than @entity10 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 tidal heating has likely melted the interior of @entity29 , producing the volcanoes , fractures and other geological features that @entity25 saw on that bitterly cold , icy surface 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 " @entity10 , which is slightly smaller than @entity29 , will likely be very different from @entity26 's large moon , but researchers expect the dwarf planet to have similar features to @entity29 , including internal density and bulk composition , and similarly low temperatures on its frozen surface 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 @entity80 also discovered atmospheric plumes on @entity29 , according to @entity3 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 the discovery , said @entity3 researchers , made it " one of the active known bodies in the outer solar system , along with 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 @entity88 's moon @entity86 and @entity90 's @entity89 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 " scientists are hoping the @entity2 mission will help establish whether @entity10 or its largest moon , @entity94 , falls into this category 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 space agency officials caution , however , when @entity2 makes its closest fly - by of @entity10 on july 14 , 2015 , " it will not be a replay of @entity25 , but more of a sequel and a reboot 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 " @entity2 is more technologically advanced than @entity25 , and it 's also exploring a whole new planetary system , so researchers expect to make new discoveries 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 monday , august 25 , also marks another milestone anniversary for @entity3 : two years ago , @entity105 reached interstellar space , defined by @entity80 scientist dr	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
 @entity107 as " the space between the stars 	@entity3 's @entity2 mission hurtles toward @placeholder in historic 3 billion mile expedition
