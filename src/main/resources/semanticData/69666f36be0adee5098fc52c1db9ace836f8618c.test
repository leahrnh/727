( @entity3 ) at first blush , @entity0 and @entity1 seem like any other small business owners -- polite , hardworking and passionate about what they do 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 but there 's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from " hi " s to highs 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " there 's always a moment of hesitation of ' when are they going to ask us what we do 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 ' and ' how are they going to receive that when we tell them 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et

 she and @entity0 , 34 , own the @entity22 , a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of @entity25 , @entity26 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 the couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010 , but when @entity26 became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana , they saw a once - in - a - lifetime business opportunity 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 previously , they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of @entity25 ; when the new legislation took effect on january 1 , 2014 , they could then sell to any of the 30,000 - plus tourists ( 21 years or older ) who visited the town during peak season 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 by the end of the first day of " recreational " sales , they knew their lives had changed forever 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 the two said they brought in more than $ 47,000 in sales , roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 the long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town 's " family - friendly " atmosphere now , the pair 's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new @entity64 , " which premieres sunday , april 19 , at 10 p	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et

 in 2014 , legal marijuana was a $ 700 million industry in @entity26 and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the @entity71 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 and , according to a a 2014 @entity72 , 51 % of @entity71 favored legalizing marijuana , though that was down from the previous year 's approval of 58 % 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 it 's a majority , but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 here are the next states to legalize pot " we want to show people that it 's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter , " @entity1 said 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " it 's business - minded people -- hardworking @entity71 -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " she and @entity0 are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public 's opinion 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et

 our job was created ; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk , " @entity0 said 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 as pioneers in a newly legalized business , the risks @entity0 and @entity1 face go above and beyond those of your average small business 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 while the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in @entity26 , the federal government still considers it a schedule i controlled substance like heroin or @entity124 , a dangerous drug with " no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " that classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers , even legal ones 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 few even try 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 this is pot 's $ 3 billion banking problem and forget about paying for your pot with plastic 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 like most @entity26 cannabis stores , the @entity22 is a cash only business 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 without access to banking , @entity1 and @entity0 are forced to pay their staff , their suppliers and even their taxes in cash 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 the two recognize that " budtender " might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on , but for the most part , there has been surprising support : @entity1 even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start @entity22 more than five years ago 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " for both of us , it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different , " @entity1 said 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et

 ' " he laughs 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 @entity1 had a similar experience with her grandma , until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " she thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers , " she said 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 the couple says their grandmothers ' attitude shift is what they 're hoping for on a larger scale : while you may not agree with them , entrepreneurs in four states and the @entity196 are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 " we 're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it , too 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
 but that 's not what this business is about , " @entity1 said 	the @placeholder airs sundays at 10 p.m. et
