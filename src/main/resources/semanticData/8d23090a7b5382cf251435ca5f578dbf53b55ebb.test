 you start thinking about seeing the shooter right there 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 you start thinking about -- just all kinds of things and what 's it going to be like 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 and it just races in your head , if you let it , you know 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 so part of the coping skills is you just do n't let it 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 go do something different 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 go exercise 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
 go hang out with your wife 	trial for @placeholder theater shooting suspect begins monday
