( @entity1 ) the terrorist group @entity0 has claimed an attack on @entity3 in eastern @entity4 , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in @entity14 is deteriorating fast 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages

 cross-border raids into @entity4 by the group , however , date back to 2011 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages

 @entity0 is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the @entity36 as @entity37 and @entity38 ( also known as @entity39 ) , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 its origins lie in @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of @entity48 in 1991 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 these disparate groups fought each other and a @entity52 peacekeeping mission in the @entity15 civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 @entity0 ( literally " the youth " ) split from @entity43 in 2003 and merged with another radical @entity60 group , the so - called @entity59 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 as their alliance obtained control of @entity15 's capital @entity69 in 2006 , @entity61 , the only majority @entity62 country in the region , took military action against the group 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 the offensive weakened @entity0 and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern @entity15 , but it failed to defeat it 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 to the contrary , @entity61 's invasion and occupation of parts of @entity15 -- although invited by the @entity15 government and backed by the @entity30 -- enabled @entity0 to partially re-invent itself as both an @entity60 and nationalist force opposing a foreign " @entity62 " invasion 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 initially , the group primarily attacked @entity61 forces , but soon began to " expand " its activities against the @entity15 government as well 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages

 increasing its links with @entity37 , @entity0 declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to @entity38 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 much will depend on how the relationships between @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , a long - time ally of @entity0 based in @entity97 , and @entity38 develop 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 the key point is that @entity0 's attack in @entity100 is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden - variety fundamentalist terrorism 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of @entity114 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages

 but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by @entity0 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
 as @entity100 shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit 	terrorist group @entity0 has attacked a @placeholder college , killing and taking hostages
