below is an excerpt from @entity3 commentator @entity2 's new book , " @entity4 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 " @entity2 appears daily in " @entity5 " on @entity3 from 4 to 7 p	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
m	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 et	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 in his new book , " @entity4 , " @entity2 says parenting might be on the decline more than schools are 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i never presumed to have any more answers about being a parent than anybody else 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 there are no perfect parents , perfect kids , perfect families -- only degrees of dysfunction 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 you get up in the morning and do the best you can 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 at the end of the day you say , " okay , that was n't so bad , let 's try it again tomorrow 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 " some of my instincts were pretty good and some of them were awful 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i did stay engaged and did n't say to hell with being a father when my first marriage ended 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 with the younger girls , i eventually made the choice to clean up my alcoholism before i pushed things to the point of no return 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 but most of the credit does to my second wife @entity35 ; to the girls ; and to @entity36 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 ultimately , i 've just been very fortunate 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i do n't know the status of parenting in @entity39 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 but i know a little about the status of education in @entity39 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 parents ' growing inability to impose manners and limits on their kids when the kids are in school is reflected in record dropout rates , as well as teen drug and alcohol abuse , teen sex , and unwed pregnancies 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 maybe it 's parenting that 's on the decline , more than the schools 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 watch @entity2 talk about " @entity4 " in @entity5 " Â» exhibit a : my wife and i have just been seated for dinner when the maitre d ' walks over and seats a young family at the table next to us and the kids start carrying on like orangutans on a leash 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 the parents are going , " @entity69 , that 's not nice , do n't throw your food , stop stuffing your mashed potatoes up your nose 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 " are mom and dad having fun yet , picking food up off the floor , apologizing to @entity80 , and wiping food flung across the table off their faces 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 some parents still have this attitude that their kids are too special to be burdened by discipline 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 and the rest of us are supposed to put up with their little mutants 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 that attitude really pisses me off 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i hate to break it to them , but the kids are n't special , and i do n't have to put up with their behavior 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 if you ca n't control your obnoxious little brats , leave them home 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 they do n't belong out in public annoying other people , period 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i do n't remember a generation of kids ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 what 's going on 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 i remember as a kid i was expected to behave myself out in public or suffer the wrath of one very angry father 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 and of all the things that used to piss him off , those expectations did n't seem unreasonable 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 something 's gone terribly wrong here 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 my guess is it has to do with the breakdown of authority , the collapse of strong family structure , and the abdication of parental responsibility , dictated in part by the necessity that both parents work 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 plus , we have a whole generation of @entity124 who are too busy feeling entitled to prolong their own self - indulgent , self - absorbed adolescences to rein in their own kids 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
 just a theory 	@placeholder ca n't recall a generation " ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly "
