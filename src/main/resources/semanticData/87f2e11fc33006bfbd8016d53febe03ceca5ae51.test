( @entity0 ) much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the @entity4 this year , increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central @entity4 crossing from @entity12 to @entity13 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the flows of migrants across the @entity4 are unlikely to stop -- @entity13 authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in @entity12 are waiting to cross , following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in @entity13 last year 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 these flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world , with a total estimate of 51	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
2 million people 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the latest sinking has triggered some action in the @entity30 , which has unveiled a new ten - point action plan 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the plan includes both deterrent mechanisms , such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system , but also an expansion of search - and - rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme , though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 but some @entity30 critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in a column published in the @entity52 's @entity51 newspaper just hours before the sinking , @entity48 declared : " it 's time to get @entity55 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 bring on the gunships , force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 " since then , @entity55 's prime minister , @entity61 , has also suggested that @entity62 adopt a tougher approach , saying , " the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of @entity62 adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the @entity4 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 " so what would it mean if the @entity30 did " get @entity55 " in its approach to asylum seekers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 and could @entity55 's current policy be used as a global solution , or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the @entity4 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 there were dramatic changes in @entity55 's immigration policy in 2013 , in the final months of the @entity90 government , led by @entity91 , which have been followed up and taken further by the current @entity93 national coalition government , led by @entity61 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in 2013 , with bipartisan support of those two major parties , mainland @entity55 was legally " excised " from the migration zone 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 it was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in @entity55 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 all people who seek to enter @entity55 by sea , under the @entity102 , are no longer entitled to enter or stay in @entity55 while their refugee claims are processed 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 instead , they can be transported to detention facilities in @entity105 or @entity106 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 alternatively , under a recent agreement , they can also agree to move to @entity109 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 beyond this , the @entity61 government has also returned some boats to @entity113 without processing asylum seeker claims and , in two instances , to @entity116 following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 that process was widely condemned by human rights advocates , given ongoing human rights abuses in @entity116 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 that shift in policy under successive @entity90 and now the @entity126 governments in @entity55 has been chiefly designed as a deterrent : or , to use @entity61 's slogan , to " stop the boats " 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 so has it worked 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 @entity131 , the numbers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 if your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in @entity55 each year , then " no advantage " ( meaning no asylum in @entity55 ) and " stop the boats " ( including the turning back of boats in international waters ) has worked 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in 2013 , the @entity55 government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived ; in 2014 , there were 0 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn - backs 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 so we do not know how many boats tried to enter @entity55 waters with asylum seekers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 it also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in @entity55 waters during the 2013 - 2014 period 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 @entity61 explained the tactic of secrecy and turn - back in the following statement : " we are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 and if we were at war , we would n't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 " if we accept that these responses have worked , the question for @entity55 's government is whether it is sustainable , and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger @entity181 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in sum , if this policy had to end due to its financial cost , has this policy been a " solution " 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the later years of the @entity188 administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001 's " @entity191 , " which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity91 government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones ; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability , leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the @entity91 era 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the earlier @entity188 years of deterrence did not provide long - term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 at present , in the greater @entity209 region , we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to @entity55 shores 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased , in particular , in the @entity217 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 at the same time , the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the @entity181 has increased ; they are just not making it to @entity55 yet 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 on cost alone , it is hard to see @entity55 's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in @entity62 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 for @entity55 , these short - term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 a 2014 report by the @entity227 estimated that the @entity55 government may have spent as much as a $ 10 billion ( $ 7	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
72 billion ) on its detention policies since mid- 2007 -- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as a $ 440,000 ( $ 343,000 ) 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 for comparison , we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in @entity13 would cost a $ 75 billion ( $ 58	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
5 billion ) 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity55 government 's ability to " stop the boats " -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors , including tolerance from @entity113 , significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in @entity55 for those who arrived by boat from july 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse , as we saw with the death of an @entity261 refugee in the @entity262 on @entity263 and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the @entity262 in @entity106 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity55 government 's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach @entity55 by boat , and then their relocation to @entity106 or @entity105 ( or perhaps @entity109 ) , does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that @entity55 has to these populations 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the operation to stop and return the boats , called " @entity276 " has been politically tumultuous for @entity55 's relationship with @entity113 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 returning boats to international waters potentially violates @entity55 's obligation to international maritime law ; push - backs to @entity113 waters violates @entity113 's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in 2013 and 2014 , the @entity55 government sought the @entity116 government 's assistance to intercept those attempting to flee , and receive those who had already fled the country , at a time when that government was under investigation by the @entity294 for war crimes and crimes against humanity 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 as the situation in @entity62 illustrates , just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in the short term , the " stop the boats " approach appears to be working for the @entity55 government 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 it is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 it certainly has not ended people smuggling or people 's attempts to seek asylum in the wider @entity181 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 @entity317 argues that the recent tragedy in @entity13 is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations , but requires consistent and long - term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 this is a message that both the @entity30 and @entity55 should heed 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 @entity13 is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity13 government ended its @entity331 search and rescue program last autumn , which was effective but was also costing the @entity13 government € 9	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
5 million per month 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 it was replaced by a much smaller @entity30 - run program , @entity335 , which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of @entity331 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity339 , @entity340 , has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and " more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives " 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 in @entity13 , both @entity331 and @entity335 were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in @entity347 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the migrants currently in @entity12 are in a perilous limbo , with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 @entity12 and with @entity351 noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has " eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of @entity12 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 " second , such policies have significant legal implications 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 the @entity361 has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of @entity55 's migration zone , an area that today includes all of @entity55 territory for the purposes of boat arrivals 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 by contrast , the @entity369 ruled in 2012 that efforts by the @entity13 government to return migrants intercepted at sea to @entity12 violated its legal obligations under the @entity375 because the migrants " were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the @entity13 authorities 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
 " this suggests that similar practices to @entity55 's would be illegal under the @entity375 	migrants risk their lives by paying people smugglers to get them to @placeholder
