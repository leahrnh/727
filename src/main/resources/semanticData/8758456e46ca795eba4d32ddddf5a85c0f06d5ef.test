 both services suspected @entity1 was behind their attacks and used the @entity9 to carry it out , according to statements and media reports 	attacks by the " @placeholder " are in the open and could draw international ire , the authors of the study say

 the firewall , in a manner of speaking , stands aside and watches all digital traffic going in and out of @entity1 , the researchers say 	attacks by the " @placeholder " are in the open and could draw international ire , the authors of the study say
 if it sees requests going out into the world for content it does n't want citizens to see , the researchers say , it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the @entity1 user 's computer to make them stop communicating 	attacks by the " @placeholder " are in the open and could draw international ire , the authors of the study say

 the @entity22 takes on a much lighter load , because it does n't care about all that traffic 	attacks by the " @placeholder " are in the open and could draw international ire , the authors of the study say
 instead , it targets traffic between a handful of web addresses 	attacks by the " @placeholder " are in the open and could draw international ire , the authors of the study say
