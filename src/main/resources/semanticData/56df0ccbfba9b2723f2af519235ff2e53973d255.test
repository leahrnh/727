( @entity1 ) i would have done anything to get to @entity3 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear , hard as that may be to believe 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 simply put , i have a better life now than i did before 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 but my journey across the @entity11 , like those of thousands of other migrants , was n't easy 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 here 's my story 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it all started late last year when i lost my job in @entity17 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 my work visa had expired , and i had nowhere else to go 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i 'm @entity19 , and returning to @entity19 was n't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 but @entity19 do n't need visas to get into @entity23 , so @entity23 it was 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i arrived in the country in december with an old dream in my mind : reaching @entity3 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 while in @entity28 , i discovered many @entity30 pages about illegal smuggling from @entity23 to @entity32 by sea 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 all of them mentioned that @entity35 , a port city on the southern border , was the jump off point , so i made my way there 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i met a @entity19 guy in a hotel in @entity35 who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 he told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 reputation : it was a funny thing to hear for the first time , the thought that these people , who i always considered to be little more than criminals , were concerned about what people thought of them 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 but why would n't they be 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it 's a long - term business , and the @entity19 conflict is n't ending anytime soon 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 so i decided to meet the guy 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company , with the usual transaction fees 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 when i reached @entity32 the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i 'd be able to get some of it back 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 " be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , " the smuggler told me 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 they gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it was far from @entity35 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we walked for 30 minutes , through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach , in darkness to avoid detection by police 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 the idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i still remember an old lady , barely able to walk , with her two sons , marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 they were told that if they did n't walk faster , the boat would leave without them 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 finally we reached the boat 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it was just as the smuggler described 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 for three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we were in the middle of the @entity11 , far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 but there was no going back -- it 's a one - way ticket 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we sailed for eight hours before the boat 's engine broke down 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards @entity133 the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a @entity137 or @entity138 boat , anyone who could help us 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 luckily , before long , a @entity133 coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to @entity23 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 @entity23 authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 some of the people i had been traveling with said they were n't going to try to make the trip again 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i 'd already lost everything 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 my family did n't know what i was doing , but i dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i was n't going to stop 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 two days later i received the call , and again i headed to a smuggling point 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 this time , they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship , in fact , maybe 85 meters long or more 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over @entity19 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 and for the first time , i began to feel like i was in jail , trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we lived in the hold 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 there were no mattresses or sheets , but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes for five days we had no food and little water 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 but at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the " toilet , " if you could call it that , which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship , the smell of urine emanating from the corner 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near @entity218 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern @entity32 our guides began to alert @entity32 authorities to our presence 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we were adrift at sea , they told the authorities , with no captain or crew 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 and that was actually true -- we did n't have a registered pilot , just one guy who had worked on this ship before 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 an @entity232 ship -- working in conjunction with @entity234 , the joint @entity236 border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from @entity240 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 the rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 the other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other : " stop waving , they 've already seen us 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 " i was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i can still see it like it was yesterday ; it was the rebirth of a new life 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 why migrants head to @entity11 they took us to @entity257 , on @entity258 , where we finally reached land a day later 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 when we arrived , the first thing the @entity32 authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 there was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat , a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 they were saying : " we did n't risk everything to be refugees 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we are not going to give our fingerprints , even if they torture us 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 " later that night a @entity279 - @entity32 man told us not to worry : " they will not fingerprint you 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 " they would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 twelve days after it began , our journey to @entity3 was over 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i spent two days in @entity258 before making my way first to @entity287 with two @entity19 guys who had become friends 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 we decided to go to @entity290 and went to @entity291 first and ended up in a city called @entity293 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 i did n't know where my fellow travellers were heading , but i knew one thing : my dream of making it to @entity3 , no matter the cost and risk involved , had been achieved 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
 it was worth it 	@entity303 describes harrowing 12 - day journey from @placeholder to @entity32
