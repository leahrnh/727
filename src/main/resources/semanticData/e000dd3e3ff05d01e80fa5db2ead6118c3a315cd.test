( @entity0 ) -- behind nearly every @entity2 tragedy is a conspiracy theory 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 think @entity5 's assassination , even the 9/11 attacks 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 so it 's no surprise that there have been similar doubts that a fuel tank explosion caused the 1996 crash of @entity13 , killing all 230 people aboard 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 that was the government 's ruling , yet it never quelled the theory that a missile strike brought down the plane off the coast of @entity21 , @entity22 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 so why is an upcoming documentary set to air on an obscure cable channel that rehashes this theory getting so much attention this week 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " @entity13 " is based on the claims of former federal investigators who took part in the initial probe and witnesses who say their accounts were not taken seriously 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 they want a do - over 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 @entity35 , who was the @entity36 's senior accident investigator for @entity13 , is among the ex-investigators featured in the documentary calling for a new probe into what caused the crash 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 he said the @entity36 's final report on the crash ignored witnesses , misinterpreted bomb residue and misanalyzed radar data 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 bottom line , according to the documentary producers : " one or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " the documentary does not identify or speculate about who fired the ordnance ; it says only that they most likely were launched from the waters off @entity21 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 they are hoping that the @entity36 , the nation 's top investigative agency for plane crashes , will determine that by reopening the investigation into @entity13 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 all this is fueling suspicion that has been around for years about a possible cover - up 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 one story that surfaced shortly after the crash laid out an elaborate conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by a @entity68 " friendly fire " incident that was followed by a huge government cover - up 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 the report was co-authored by @entity72 , @entity73 and the late former @entity75 reporter @entity74 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 @entity72 later apologized for the report , saying " my effort to pin the crash 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 on the @entity68 was reckless and a mistake 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " related : still ' paranoid ' after all these years conspiracy talk gets people 's attention 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 as @entity0 commenter @entity83 points out : " conspiracies are very comforting creatures 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " they give society " bad guys to hunt 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " and any proof that contradicts the conspiracy " becomes more ' proof ' that there 's a conspiracy 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " and colleagues of the ex-investigators featured in the documentary fear this is nothing more than an effort to stir up conspiracy theories 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " i would never be part of any cover - up 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 period , " former @entity36 official @entity101 told @entity0 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 @entity101 , who served on the five - member @entity36 during the investigation , said he " took offense " at any suggestion that his team ignored evidence 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 none of the evidence detailing how the plane fell apart supports the missile theory , he said 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 it 's not like the missile theory was dismissed at the outset , said the top @entity116 investigator on the case , @entity118 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " we took the 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 possibility a missile brought down the plane very , very seriously , " @entity118 told @entity0 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " we we 're 99 % sure that this was not a terrorist 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " but what about that remaining 1 % 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 there are parts of the investigation that can point " any way you want , " @entity101 said 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 but most importantly , he said , the pieces of the puzzle have to be judged " as a whole 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " how about the former investigators in the documentary who are calling for a new probe 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 do they stand to gain anything from all this 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " there 's no motive in this other than we want to get it straight , " said @entity35 , who wrote a petition asking the @entity36 to reopen its investigation 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " it 's a matter of personal integrity for us 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 we have nothing to gain financially or otherwise 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " read the petition @entity118 said he does n't question @entity35 ' motives , but he added , " i just wished if someone felt that strongly about speaking like that , they could have brought it to someone 's attention 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 commencing with the investigation -- not wait 17 years until they get their pensions in their pockets and then come out with it 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " longtime aviation journalist @entity162 thought one point was worth noting : the documentary boasts that " investigators finally break their silence 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " that 's interesting because , @entity170 says , one of the investigators actually testified during a @entity172 hearing in 1999 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " it would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago , " @entity170 wrote in her @entity0 opinion piece 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 much of the documentary -- which was made available to the media before its july 17 premiere -- rests its theory on an analysis of the evidence by the film 's co-producer , @entity184 , who was not involved in the probe 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 a longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation , @entity184 has been vexed by witness accounts that are at odds with the fuel tank explosion theory 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 of course if the disaster happened today , the world would weigh in almost immediately on what witnesses saw based on countless smartphone videos of the blast that would pop up online 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 so , will the @entity36 have to go back to square one all these years later 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 @entity118 -- a former @entity116 assistant director -- said he would n't be opposed to the @entity116 joining with the @entity36 to take another look at the case 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 the agency told @entity0 it has received @entity35 ' petition and " will respond to the petitioners once a determination is made 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " the @entity36 noted that petitions must be based on new evidence or " on a showing that the @entity36 's findings are erroneous 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " new evidence 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 the basic claim that a missile hit the plane is n't new , wrote @entity170 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 the radar data does n't appear to be new either , according to journalist @entity213 , one of @entity0 's lead producers covering the disaster 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " as far as i can tell from reading the petition , there 's no new evidence , " @entity213 said 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " but their alternative interpretation of existing evidence and their assumptions alone probably will not be sufficient to persuade the @entity36 to start all over again from scratch 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
 " whatever comes out of all this , it 's unlikely to smother the debate and the conspiracy theories swirling around one of aviation history 's most mysterious plane crashes 	allegations that @placeholder / @entity116 crash probe was flawed fuels conspiracy theories
