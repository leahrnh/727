( @entity0 ) -- rarely seen by outsiders , the daily life of a regional @entity3 commander named @entity4 and his militant fighters is dominated by extremes : love and war , attack and retreat , life and death 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 for nine days in october 2009 , @entity15 journalist @entity14 was behind the lines with the @entity3 , embedded as no @entity18 filmmaker before him 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 and he was there to witness firsthand the jarring juxtapositions in @entity4 's life , at turns -- directing an attack against @entity26 forces in @entity28 's treacherous mountains -- then hours later at home , a father playing with his children 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 to capture these intimate and unprecedented images , @entity14 risked his life to embed with @entity4 and his fighters in @entity35 -- the northeastern region where @entity36 is active and @entity37 was once rumored to be hiding 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity38 : kidnapped by the @entity3 @entity14 said he does n't know the number of militants under @entity4 's command , but included in their ranks is another of @entity4 's sons -- a boy 12 or 13 years old 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 the son carries a machine gun nearly as large as he is , @entity14 said 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " for @entity4 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 it 's not something bad to send your 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 son out to fight , " he told @entity0 's @entity48 , because @entity4 believes that " 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 his son will come to heaven when and if he dies in this war 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " there are many different groups that make up the @entity3 , and they are fighting for many different reasons 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity4 says he and his men joined the @entity3 to drive out foreign forces from his district 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " we fight for our freedom , our religion , our honor and we fight for our land , " @entity4 tells @entity63 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 commanding his forces from a house built of stone and clay , he says he relies on contributions to fund his operation 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 firm casualty figures for both sides in the decade - long war are hard to come by 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 it 's not known how many @entity3 forces have been killed fighting @entity26 - led coalition forces 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 according to the @entity82 , more than 2,200 coalition troops have died in @entity28 since @entity26 forces invaded in response to the 9/11 attacks 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 more than 1,400 @entity26 are among those coalition deaths 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 as he urges his fighters to battle , @entity4 questions coalition motives 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " for what purpose are they fighting us 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " asks @entity4 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " are they oppressed 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 have they been treated unfair 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 are they living in a dictatorship 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " oppression is an accusation critics have aimed at the @entity3 for decades 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 they rule their lives by an extremely strict interpretation of @entity102 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 in places under their control , women shroud their faces and bodies in burqas and girls are forbidden to attend school 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " there is nothing that @entity102 does not have the solution for , " @entity111 , a local @entity3 judge , explains to @entity63 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " if a person cuts off another person 's hand , then according to @entity102 law , you have the right to retaliate and cut his hand off 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 it 's the same with the ears , the teeth the eyes and the nose 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " the @entity3 government ruled @entity28 -- and gave safe harbor to @entity36 terrorist training camps -- from the mid- 1990s until 2001 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 leaders refused to extradite @entity37 , prompting the @entity26 invasion which toppled the @entity3 government and made way for national elections 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 a decade later , @entity4 's fighters march through @entity35 's difficult terrain with heavy firearms and bandoliers of ammunition slung across their shoulders 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 some wear traditional @entity28 clothing and others dress in camouflage military fatigues as they trudge across canyons dotted with rocks , small trees and scrubby vegetation 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 as @entity63 films , @entity4 directs an attack on @entity26 troops , coordinating the operation by hand - held radio from a mountain perch overlooking a valley road hundreds of feet below 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 eighty holy warriors are participating in this assault , @entity4 says 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 they 've taken positions in eight different places in groups of ten men each 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " attack , attack , with the help of @entity164 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " @entity4 shouts into his radio 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " you hit the vehicle , you hit it 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " but did the fighters damage a vehicle or kill coalition forces as they thought 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 the answer seems to be no	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 apparently , the attack was n't even worthy of a report 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity0 contacted coalition headquarters 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 a @entity26 press officer searched through 1,800 reports from october 2009 and said , " to be clear : we have no reports of any @entity3 attacks in that area during the timeframe given 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " as the attack ends , the sound of gunfire echoes across the valley , a plume of smoke rising in the distance 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " @entity3 are like most @entity102 insurgents , " said @entity14 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " when they have spare time , they read the @entity191 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 they do n't train 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 from what i could see from the firing they were not very accurate 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " he acknowledges that he expects criticism for being embedded with fighters trying to ambush coalition forces 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " i understand that this is very emotional for people -- especially people in the armed forces , " @entity14 told @entity48 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " i 'm a journalist , i just film what happened 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " the war has become " routine " for this band of @entity3 fighters , said @entity14 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " they do an ambush and then spend the rest of the day sitting around gossiping on the radio 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 they sit , they drink a lot of tea and they have some games they are playing 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " one of the games is a simple rock throwing contest 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 standing in a relatively flat clearing , the men square off to see who can throw heavy rocks the farthest 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 most use a two - handed thrust - from - the - chest technique 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 in the end , the commander wins 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " this is everyday life , " @entity14 told @entity48 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " this is the @entity3 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " one day , @entity63 notices @entity4 is nervous about a suspicious plane flying over the @entity3 fighter 's hideout 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 the commander orders @entity63 to remain inside 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 later , @entity63 hears gunfire 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity4 knocks at the door telling @entity14 to get out immediately 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " leave your things , " the commander says 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " run 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " " we found an old abandoned shed and we slept there during the night " as the gunfire continued , said @entity14 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 by daybreak @entity14 is told that a dozen people -- including @entity244 's top lieutenant -- had been killed in a @entity246 raid 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity14 finds @entity4 " crying like a kid " over his lost men 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 later , @entity4 flees with his family , fearing for his life 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 @entity14 knows that the images he captured will be surprising to many -- and disturbing to some 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 but he feels confident that the images are authentic , not an attempt at propaganda 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 if the @entity3 wanted to create propaganda , they would demonstrate a show of strength -- not their softer side , he said 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 " showing them [ selves ] as humans , they do n't understand any purpose of that 	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
 "	@placeholder journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
