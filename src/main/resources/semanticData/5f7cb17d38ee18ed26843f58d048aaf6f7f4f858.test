( @entity2 ) @entity1 's @entity0 this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in @entity9 , @entity10 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to @entity13 : " i 'm on television and you 're in a f * * king trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 makes my skin crawl even being here 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 " and , finally , " lose some weight , baby girl 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 " it 's pretty cringe - worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 @entity25 quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 it was , however , too late : the # firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on @entity35 , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and " ugly on the inside " to a " sad , self - hating coward 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 " @entity1 , meanwhile , announced that @entity25 would be suspended for a week 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 certainly @entity25 should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our @entity42 age , such missteps always come to light 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 but while @entity25 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on @entity25 without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only @entity25 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 @entity25 knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 the employee even threatens to make the video public 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 did @entity25 keep going because she has that much of a self - destructive streak 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 or because she truly could not help herself 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 how @entity0 could have responded these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's @entity82 or @entity83 or @entity0 , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 the high price of public shaming online sure , @entity25 probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , @entity25 lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 you know what gives her the nerve 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 we do 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 ( be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 ) but we 're really no better than she is 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 it 's the " power of the press " without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 think about it 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 who was worse : @entity25 or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 who is worse : @entity0 for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the @entity35 masses who call for justice and " the return of class " -- who express views like , " part of me feels bad for @entity0 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 poor thing actually believes she was hired for ' brains ' and ' education ' 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 should n't they question whether , in fact , @entity25 could have actually been standing up for herself 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
 at least @entity0 owns up to it 	video shows @placeholder reporter @entity0 berating and belittling a tow company worker
