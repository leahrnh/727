( @entity2 ) @entity1 life seen swimming in unusual places 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 water temperatures warmer than they should be 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 no snow where there should be feet of it 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 some scientists are saying " @entity12 " could be playing a factor 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 as monikers go , the blob does n't sound very worrisome 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 but if you 're a salmon fisherman in @entity16 or a @entity18 resident hoping to see the end of the drought , the blob could become an enemy of top concern 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 a @entity24 climate scientist and his associates have been studying the blob -- a huge area of unusually warm water in the @entity29 -- for months 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " in the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big , almost circular mass of water that just did n't cool off as much as it usually did , so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year , " said @entity30 , who works at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity16 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 @entity30 , who gave the blob its name , said it was 1,000 miles long , 1,000 miles wide and 100 yards deep in 2014 -- and it has grown this year 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 and it 's not the only one ; there are two others that emerged in 2014 , @entity44 of the @entity45 -- part of the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) -- said in september 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 one is in the @entity48 and the other is off the coast of @entity18 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 waters in the blob have been warmer by about 5	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
5 degrees , a significant rise 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 a recent set of studies published in @entity56 by @entity30 's group points to a high - pressure ridge over the @entity59 that has calmed ocean waters for two winters 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the result was more heat staying in the water because storms did n't kick up and help cool the surface water 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " the warmer temperatures we see now are n't due to more heating , but less winter cooling , " a recent news release from the @entity24 announcing the studies said 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the university has worked with @entity47 on the research 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 according to @entity76 magazine , some marine species are exploring the warmer waters , leading some fish to migrate hundreds of miles from their normal habitats 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the magazine cited fisherman and wildlife officials in @entity84 who have seen skipjack tuna and thresher sharks 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 @entity88 killer whales have been spotted off the coast of @entity16 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " i 've never seen some of these species here before , " @entity90 of the @entity91 in @entity32 told the @entity76 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 and he was worried about the adult @entity29 salmon that normally feed on tiny crustaceans and other food sources that are not around in the same numbers off the coast of the @entity99 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " they had nothing to eat , " he told the magazine of last year 's conditions in the blob 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 it appears that food has moved to cooler waters 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 in january , @entity30 told the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity16 , that his concern is for very young salmon that are still upstream 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " in particular , the year class that would be going to sea next spring , " he said 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 @entity47 said in a news release last month that @entity18 sea lion pups have been found extremely underweight and dying , possibly because of an ocean with fewer things to eat 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , " @entity120 , assistant stranding coordinator for @entity47 on the @entity59 , told @entity2 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the numbers are overwhelming facilities that care for the stranded sea lions , most of whom are pups , local officials said 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 record number of sea lion pups stranded in @entity18 the blob also is affecting life on land 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 for the past few years , that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the @entity59 dry and warm , exacerbating the drought in @entity18 , @entity138 and @entity16 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 one of the primary problems is small snow accumulation in the mountains 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 in early april , officials measured the snowpack in @entity18 at a time when it should be the highest 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 this year it hit an all - time low at 1	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
4 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the annual average 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the previous low for april 1 had been 25 % in 1977 and 2014 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places

 @entity153 , in announcing water restrictions the same day , stood on a patch of dry , brown grass in the @entity157 mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 low @entity18 snowpack ushers mandatory water restrictions the heat has caused rising air , which can lead to conditions that produce more thunderstorms 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 with warmer air in @entity18 , areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 that has led to the lower snowpack and helped compound the drought 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the storms also mean more lightning and more wildfires 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 and the blob affects people on other areas of the country 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 that same persistent jet stream pattern has allowed cold air to spill into much of the @entity182 and @entity183 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 this stuck pattern has led to the record cold and snow in the @entity182 and @entity187 over the last two seasons with record snows we have seen in @entity191 and @entity192 , and the most snow we have seen in decades for cities such as @entity195 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 the weather pattern is confusing the experts 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 there are some that think it might be a @entity202 , a long - lasting @entity204 - like pattern in the @entity29 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 @entity205 , a professor of atmospheric science at the @entity24 , does n't believe the answer is clear 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " i do n't think we know 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " he said in the university 's news release 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " maybe it will go away quickly and we wo n't talk about it anymore , but if it persists for a third year , then we 'll know something really unusual is going on 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
 " @entity2 's @entity215 contributed to this report 	@placeholder life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
