( @entity1 ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today 's @entity7 fighters 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 we are all familiar with the brutality of @entity10 , the self - anointed @entity11 , or @entity12 , the @entity14 terrorists who have pledged allegiance to @entity10 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 this new wave of violent @entity18 groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 but there is something very different about the way they treat women 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 the jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 killing the enemy , the men , is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 what they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a " caliphate , " a @entity49 - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or , rather , to the group 's interpretation of life in the early days of @entity55 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 @entity57 girls who slipped @entity10 after its siege of @entity59 describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 there , they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for @entity10 fighters to choose among them , some for marriage , others for sexual slavery 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 the stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 an investigation by @entity74 found " a system of organized rape and sexual assault , sexual slavery , and forced marriage by @entity10 forces , " actions that the group says " are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 " in @entity14 , @entity12 also has a very specific approach to women 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 the 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014 , according to @entity91 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 there , too , women captives move from house to house and village to village , forced to convert when they are not @entity98 , and prepare for marriage to jihadis 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 it 's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis , when @entity103 headed @entity104 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 women were not a big part of @entity104 's immediate plans because @entity104 , unlike @entity10 , viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal , one for future generations 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 in contrast , @entity10 is actively engaged in building those social structures 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 and if you want to build a new society , you need more than soldiers 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 you also need women 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community , even one whose laws are brutally repressive 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 even if women are viewed as the property of men , they are still needed , not just for cooking , cleaning and sex , but to keep the home and raise children ; hence the methodical capture , assault and subjugation 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 it is no accident that @entity12 has targeted students , as it did in @entity134 , or that @entity136 's @entity135 killed scores of women in the massacre at @entity141 's @entity140 in @entity141 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 as in previous conflicts , women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 it is a way to humiliate the enemy , a " reward " for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 during the @entity157 war of the 1990s , experts said @entity159 soldiers engaged in systematic rape , thinking the babies of raped @entity163 women would be @entity159 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 in @entity165 , government - backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-arab groups 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 but this is different 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 the women are not simply abused and discarded 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 @entity10 and @entity12 are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule , subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide , according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of @entity182 during the rule of the @entity184 , another radical @entity55 group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 @entity10 is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women , including the selling of @entity57 prisoners as slaves , is in keeping with @entity55 law 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 its online magazine cites @entity55 writings proclaiming : " we will conquer your @entity197 , break your crosses , and enslave your women , by the permission of @entity202 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 " the worst fate is reserved for non-muslims , such as @entity57 , but @entity98 women in areas seized by @entity135 have seen disaster 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 from @entity208 , @entity209 's second - largest city , a modern town until @entity10 conquered it last year , women say , " they have withheld all freedoms from us " and describe oppressive , fear - filled lives 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 the brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 if it is madness , it is madness with a method 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
 and when it comes to women , the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision , one where some women say life is simply not worth living 	@entity233 : @placeholder and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
