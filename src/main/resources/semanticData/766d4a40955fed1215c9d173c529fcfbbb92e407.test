( @entity0 ) can you imagine paying $ 1,000 a month in rent to live in a one - car garage 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 @entity4 , a 30 - year - old woman , does n't have to imagine this scenario because it 's her everyday reality 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 the small and unusual living space is all that this employed , single mother can afford in her high - cost community in @entity9 , @entity10 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 @entity4 is n't alone in her struggles 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 @entity0 recently published a powerful piece called " poor kids of @entity14 " that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the @entity18 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people , including 11 children 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 another chronicles a husband and wife named @entity26 and @entity27 , both of whom have jobs , who are living in a @entity33 homeless shelter with their two kids because they do n't have the money to go anywhere else 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 although @entity14 has unique characteristics , it is n't the only community confronting these challenges 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 the agency i lead , the @entity46 @entity45 , recently released a report estimating that 7	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
7 million low - income households live in substandard housing , spend more than half their incomes on rent or both 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 these are families who are dedicating $ 1 out of every $ 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 and the more they spend on housing , the less they have to invest in their children 's education , build up savings and shop at local businesses 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 these are outcomes that hurt our nation 's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 @entity45 is working with local partners across the country to do just that 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 first , we 're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 since the mid- 1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 but by 2020 , we 're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing , ending agreements to control rents in these units 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 so we 've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 we 're also doing the same with public housing 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 right now , the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year , mainly because of disrepair , @entity45 created the @entity96 initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 it 's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as @entity103 , @entity104 , where the local housing authority is making 58 years ' worth of repairs in just 22 months , including new lighting , modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 @entity96 has allowed local communities to raise more than $ 733 million in new capital to date 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 that 's why we 're asking @entity116 to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 no @entity46 should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 in addition to preservation , @entity45 is also working to create new affordable housing 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 a @entity127 study revealed that in 2012 , there were 11	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
5 million extremely low - income households and only 3	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
3 million affordable units available 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 it 's clear that we ca n't preserve our way out of this problem 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 we 've got to grow the supply to meet demand , so @entity45 is taking a multifaceted approach 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 for example , our @entity137 is leveraging $ 4 in private and other public resources for every $ 1 in @entity137 funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 this is more than just a statistic : it is progress for people , from the families living in the @entity151 development in @entity152 to the seniors living in the @entity154 in @entity155 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 to keep this momentum going , we 've asked @entity116 to increase @entity137 funding by 16 % to keep building affordable homes , prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 we are also asking @entity116 to expand our @entity162 , which allows recipients of modest means , the elderly , and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 this includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 and we 're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 for instance , @entity45 awarded $ 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the @entity18 , including @entity14 , in january 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 to empower communities , president @entity181 has also requested $ 300 million for new @entity183 to help them increase housing affordability , economic growth and access to jobs 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast - to - coast 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 our nation 's affordable housing challenges wo n't be solved overnight , and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 let 's not squander this chance to make real progress for @entity46 families 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
 by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state , local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners , i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all 	@placeholder 's @entity215 told the story of the " poor kids of @entity14 "
