 there are infinite details to master , personalities to manage , debates , and then throw in the unknowns 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 she will be 69 on @entity56 2016 and would have been in the political spotlight for a quarter century by then 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 many people might reflect on a similar public service career and conclude there 's nothing left to prove , or that it 's time for others to get in the game even if becoming the first woman president was the prize 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but what if @entity35 does n't run 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 multiple people associated with the @entity9 say there is a host of promising potential contenders 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but one strategist , a veteran of several @entity9 presidential campaigns who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely , said , " people saw governor @entity35 and senator @entity39 as superstars 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 " @entity85 has been cagey with his intentions , dropping humorous references but refusing to commit 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but his name recognition as vice president and as a veteran of the presidential campaign trail , some in the party think @entity85 is in a good position 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 though , he would be 73 on @entity56 2016 and 74 on @entity101 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 that 's " middle age " for a @entity110 senator , but no one has ever walked into the @entity104 on their first day of work at that age 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity111 , a former top @entity112 aide , thinks @entity85 " deserves a shot " because he 's been " outstanding " as vice president 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but @entity85 is @entity85 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 people either love him , hate him or forget about him 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 for some @entity9 operatives , @entity85 is almost an afterthought 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 people spouted off numerous potential @entity9 candidates and @entity85 's name would come up , eventually 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " oh yes , @entity85 , " said one strategist after gently jogging his memory 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 the progressive wing of the party is not impressed 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 @entity137 @entity9 pollster @entity138 said @entity9 @entity85 and @entity35 are n't the only two who can appeal to @entity9 voters 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 the party has " a really strong bench of candidates that people are excited about that have progressive appeal 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " she included @entity149 gov	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity137 , saying he has " quietly and consistently " built a strong record of good schools and good economy in @entity149 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 @entity111 said the " jury is out " and @entity32 mused , " i just do n't know what kind of candidate he 'd be 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " @entity125 called @entity137 " a blank slate 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " @entity137 is laying the groundwork for a run in the event @entity35 does n't , a source close to the governor told @entity1 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity137 amplified 2016 speculation when he told the @entity170 last week that he ca n't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity174 the first - term @entity176 senator would have even less experience in public office than @entity39 when he ran in 2008 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but @entity9 have a high opinion of the former @entity181 professor whose advocacy paved the way for the @entity184 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 former @entity39 aide @entity185 said @entity186 was one of a handful of " impressive " democrats who could fill the bill should @entity35 stay out 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity20 said @entity186 has to be " put on any list 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " the progressives love her for her populist agenda 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 @entity195 @entity197 sen	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity195 's name also came up as a potential contender 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 but @entity20 said she would have to get over her lack of name recognition , which she said is relatively easy to do 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity111 , however , said it 's " too soon " for @entity197 sen	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity195 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 she should show her campaigning and fundraising capabilities as head of the @entity206 's @entity112 campaign arm 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity207 the @entity197 governor received the most negative response from respondents , if he was mentioned at all 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 @entity111 said @entity207 should " stick to being the governor of @entity197 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
 " @entity125 said he represents the @entity9 from the 90s and would not fit in well with today 's voters , adding that he " pays lip service " to progressives 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some

 " untested " is how @entity33 professor @entity32 described the field outside of @entity85 and @entity35 	@entity149 gov. @entity137 and @placeholder sen. @entity174 mentioned by some
