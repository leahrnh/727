 and so far , the @entity44 have been taking heavy losses to defend @entity15 and @entity47 minorities against @entity1 	assyrians are an ancient @placeholder minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16
 every night , the fighters hear the rumbling sound of coalition airplanes in the sky over @entity52 where they have their safe house just a few miles from the frontline 	assyrians are an ancient @placeholder minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16
 here they relax , patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder @entity1 suicide commandos from entering the near city of @entity60 where @entity61 says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them @entity15 -- have found a temporary place to stay 	assyrians are an ancient @placeholder minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16

 since they are still small and have no heavy weaponry , the @entity11 fighters say they coordinate closely with local @entity40 @entity85 commanders and share the same foxholes on the frontline 	assyrians are an ancient @placeholder minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16
 the fighters are a very mixed bunch 	assyrians are an ancient @placeholder minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16
