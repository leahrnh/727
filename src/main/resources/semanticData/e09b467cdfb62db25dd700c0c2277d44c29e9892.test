 goodbye insane interest rates and fees 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 you 're sticking with your debit card from now on 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : debit card transactions are n't reported to the credit bureaus , so if you do n't use a credit card , you 'll have less of a payment history -- which hurts your fico credit score 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : i love , love , love that you want to use your debit card 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 but to keep your credit score solid , you still need to keep a few credit cards and use them at least once every few months 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 even if you think you 'll never need to borrow again , your fico credit score has a big impact 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 it can affect your auto insurance premium and whether a landlord will rent to you , and many employers even check it when vetting a job application 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves

 @entity0 : how to deal with credit card debt the bond issues good news : you 're sleeping better than ever since you moved all your retirement money out of stocks and into bonds 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : you 're approaching two land mines here 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 first up is inflation 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 make it to age 65 and there 's a good chance you 'll live another 20 years or longer 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 ( more on this in the next item 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 ) over a 20 - year period , a 4 percent average inflation rate ( the historical norm since the ' 50s ) will reduce the purchasing power of today 's dollar to about 50 cents 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 that will make it very hard to maintain your standard of living in retirement 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 bonds are n't an ideal inflation hedge , since their historical returns are typically not much better than the inflation rate 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 making matters worse , because of the financial crisis and the @entity85 's efforts to keep the economy growing , bond yields are at unprecedented lows 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 this is not a permanent situation 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 soon -- maybe this year or next -- interest rates , and thus bond yields , will start to rise 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 when rates rise , the market price of bonds falls 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 that hurts your portfolio 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : every portfolio benefits from bonds ; they provide a cushion when the stock market hits a rough patch 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 but avoiding stocks completely could mean your investment wo n't grow any faster than the rate of inflation 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 as a general rule , your age is a good guideline for the percentage of bonds you want -- if you 're 55 , put 55 percent in bonds and 45 percent in stocks 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if you 're worried about putting money in stocks right now , stick with mutual funds or exchange - traded funds ( @entity118 ) that focus on dividend - paying stocks 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 the dividend payout is a steady stream of income , much like a bond , and right now the yield on some dividend portfolios is actually higher than the yield on a five - year treasury bond 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 while dividend stocks have their own risk , if you have time on your side -- at least ten years -- you can pocket that nice dividend income today , ride out the volatility , and , over the long term , potentially earn inflation - beating gains 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 @entity0 : how to go green on the stock market live long -- and prosper 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to enjoy a long , comfortable retirement good news : you 're likely to reach a much older age than women of previous generations 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 today a woman of 65 will probably live 20 more years -- 60 percent longer than her life expectancy in 1900 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : that means more years that your 401 ( k ) and @entity146 need to support you 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : to enjoy a long , comfortable retirement , save more today 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if you 're 50 or older , take advantage of the catch - up provisions : instead of an annual 401 ( k ) max of $ 16,500 in 2010 , you 're entitled to invest $ 22,000 , and your @entity146 limit rises from the standard $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 you may also want to retire later 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 working until 67 or 70 gives those funds more time to grow -- which gives you more security 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 you do n't have to keep the high - powered career you have now ; a less demanding job will still bring in valuable income 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 retirement loans : on borrowed dimes good news : you 're in a pinch , but your company allows you to borrow from your 401 ( k ) 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : make that plural -- there are three problems with taking your company up on that loan 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 first , if you leave your job , voluntarily or not , you 'll typically have only a few months to pay back what you 've borrowed 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if you ca n't , the loan converts to a withdrawal on which you 'll owe income tax , and if you 're under 55 you 'll also be hit with a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 second , when you pull money out of any investment , it 's no longer working for your future 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 anyone who took a loan from their 401 ( k ) in early 2009 missed out when the @entity188 stock index shot up more than 60 percent from march to december 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 that was a costly time to be out of the market 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 third , your loan money will end up being taxed twice -- when you repay the loan it will be with after - tax dollars , and then in retirement , when you begin using your 401 ( k ) for living expenses , you 'll be responsible for the tax due on those withdrawals 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : make a 401 ( k ) loan an absolute last resort 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 a well - maintained emergency savings fund is a far better insurance policy against unforeseen expenses 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 as you know , i advise saving up eight months of living expenses -- especially now , when most unemployed people need at least six months to find a new job 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 kids need the darndest things good news : you 're expecting , or you have young kids 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : you may not be providing enough security for your family if something happens to you 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : you ca n't control fate , but you absolutely , positively can make sure that your children will be financially secure , no matter what 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 a term life insurance policy that 's at least 15 times your annual income will give your kids ' guardian plenty of money to raise them according to your wishes 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 i know that sounds like a lot , but these policies are remarkably inexpensive 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 @entity0 : discover the pleasures of pinching pennies shaky foundations good news : the steep decline in home prices means you can afford to buy your first home 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 hidden risk : it 's easy to underestimate the real cost of home ownership 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 how to stay on top : property tax , insurance , and maintenance can add 30 percent to your base mortgage 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 to see how that extra expense will affect you , plug in your price range for a home at @entity252 to determine your monthly mortgage payment , and then add 30 percent to that figure 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if the total is more than your current rent , spend six months " playing house " -- each month , deposit the difference between your rent and your probable mortgage payment into a separate savings account 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if you ca n't afford this exercise , you ca n't afford to buy a home at that price just yet 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 and do n't forget : before buying a home , you must have an emergency fund that can cover your expenses for eight months 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if anything happens to your job or a big expense pops up , you 'll need to have the cash to pay the mortgage 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 finally , do n't buy if there 's any chance you 'll move within five to seven years 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 if you sell a newly purchased house , you risk making too little on the sale to cover the typical 6 percent agent 's fee and your moving costs 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
 i know the housing market 's rock - bottom prices are tempting , but it 's better to be safe than sorry 	money expert @placeholder points out hidden costs to money moves
