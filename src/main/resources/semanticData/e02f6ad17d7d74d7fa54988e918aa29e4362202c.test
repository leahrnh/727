( @entity0 ) -- the detention and interrogation facility at @entity3 , @entity4 , which i have visited , has served and continues to serve an important role in the war against terrorists since it opened 10 years ago 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 it houses high - value terrorist detainees , like @entity11 , the architect of september 11 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 the military commissions ' courthouse , called the @entity14 , is a world - class , state - of - the - art facility specifically designed to accommodate the needs of both defense and prosecutors dealing with classified information 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 the detainees there are represented by civilian and military counsel , and the @entity25 has ruled that they enjoy the constitutional right of habeas corpus 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 the conditions of detention there are safe , secure and humane and comply with national and international standards , including @entity32 3 of the @entity33 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 it is important to remember that the @entity35 is engaged in armed conflict and has been since september 11 , 2001 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 the september 18 , 2001 , @entity37 , relied upon by both the @entity39 and @entity40 administrations , gives our military the legal authority to engage the enemy under appropriate circumstances 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 under the law of armed conflict , also called the law of war , engaging the enemy includes killing or capturing the enemy 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 this age - old principle -- detention of the enemy during wartime for the duration of hostilities -- is just as applicable to @entity58 as it was to @entity59 in @entity60 or other enemies in previous wars 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 this principle has been upheld by our courts , including the @entity25 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 shortly after september 11 , it became evident that this war would be different from all previous wars in the sense that we would need to rely more on tactical and strategic intelligence to thwart and defeat the enemy than traditional military might 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 to defeat @entity58 and its affiliates , we needed to know what they knew ; one of the obvious ways to learn their intentions was through lawful interrogation at a safe detention facility 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 @entity3 , used as a detention facility since the @entity80 administration , was just such a place 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 there have been 779 detainees at @entity3 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 today , there are only 171 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 but over the past decade , we have not only kept dangerous terrorists at @entity3 and thus away from the battlefield , we have learned a great deal from them during long - term , lawful interrogations 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 without a safe , secure detention and interrogation facility , we would not have gained the tactical and strategic intelligence needed to degrade and ultimately defeat the enemy 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 it has been said that the mere existence of @entity3 is a recruiting tool for the enemy 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 however , recall that there was no @entity3 detention facility when @entity58 bombed the @entity100 in the 1990s or blew up the @entity35 embassies in @entity102 in 1998 or attacked the @entity103 in 2000 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 and i suspect that if the @entity39 administration had brought the @entity3 detainees not to @entity4 but to a detention facility in the @entity35 , that facility would have been the object of their scorn and derision 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 all things considered , the detention facility at @entity3 has played an invaluable role in the war against terrorists by keeping them off the battlefield and allowing for lawful interrogations 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 neither the @entity39 nor @entity40 administrations has offered a reasonable and feasible alternative to @entity3 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 unless and until a safe , reasonable alternative facility is proposed , the @entity35 should continue to use @entity3 as a detention , interrogation and military commissions ' facility 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
 opposing view : @entity128 says @entity129 is unjust and must be closed join @entity130 on @entity131 and follow updates on @entity133 	@entity136 : @placeholder has kept terrorists off the battlefield and provided key intelligence
