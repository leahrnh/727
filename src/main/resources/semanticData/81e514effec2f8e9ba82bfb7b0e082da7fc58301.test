 @entity59 : you 're a pretty cool guy — some might be surprised to hear that you were once bullied 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 what did you experience and how did you overcome it 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity18 : when i was a kid , i had ears that stuck out the side of my head and really big green glasses 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and i was tall and lanky and definitely looked a little different than other kids 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 i think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something , because i just did n't feel like i fit in with the other kids 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 when i started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity , something that i belonged to , something that i was good at , something that people would watch me do and say , " oh wow , that 's really cool or he 's really good at that 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 " i think in that way music really gave me an anchor in my social experience 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity59 : what can students expect when they join your program 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity18 : as a new @entity94 student you 'll get to try out all the instruments 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 you 'll choose an instrument to learn 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 you 'll be paired with a mentor 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and then you 'll go throughout that year learning how to play the instrument and music fundamentals and songwriting 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and by the end of the year , you 'll be performing on stage , recording in a studio and will have a very close relationship with that mentor 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 our mentors are amazing musicians that are active in the community playing and performing 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we 're not policemen 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we 're not teachers 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we 're not parents 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we 're in a unique position to really talk to these kids about the issues that matter most to them 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity59 : why do you focus on middle schoolers 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity18 : it 's the time of their life to reach them not only musically , but also as young individuals that are starting to form opinions about who they are and what their world is going to look like 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 as professional musicians , most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 a lot of times , these kids only see to the end of their block and back 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we like to bring them to studios and also to other places in @entity3 because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 we also provide them with opportunities to get tutoring and have social services , making sure that they 're really successful in and outside of school 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity59 : i 've heard you play — you 're pretty mean on the trombone 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 how has that passion translated into your work with these kids 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 @entity18 : i 've built my life on how important the feeling i get from playing music is 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and i thought that that was the end - all , be-all feeling , that being on stage and performing was the thing for me 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 then i saw a kid have that experience through our program , and it changed everything 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 there 's an amazing sense of pride when i see a kid experience that feeling on stage , where they 've connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because they 've worked really hard and have a great performance 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 it 's an incredible feeling 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 i was really fortunate to have the opportunities that i did to learn music 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people , because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 my hopes for the children that we work with are that their vision of the world and their vision of themselves is changed in some way , that they hold themselves to more than other people might , and that they realize there 's a whole world out there that they could very much be a part of that is n't necessarily the one right outside their doorstep 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 i know music has changed my life in a really dramatic way 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
 and i think it 's going to change the lives of these students in a really dramatic way 	nonprofit group @placeholder pairs @entity3 - area kids with professional musician mentors
