( @entity6 ) the reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun , and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot , were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect , according to a @entity12 , @entity13 , investigator 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder

 @entity14 , who has been brought in to review the case , said @entity18 deputy @entity17 , 73 , " inadvertently " shot @entity19 after @entity19 -- a possibly @entity21 - addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 as deputies tried to handcuff @entity19 , @entity17 arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 he warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a taser on the suspect , but instead , he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized , @entity14 said , citing a recently released video 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 @entity14 attributed @entity17 ' actions to a phenomenon known as " slip and capture 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " an example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 the driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly , even though there 's no clutch pedal , he said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 quoting @entity51 , executive director of the @entity52 , @entity14 further explained : " these are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another , and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 in effect , your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " @entity17 announced that he was going to deploy his taser , and he pulled the trigger only once , as he was trained to do , @entity14 said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 police are trained to " double - tap " when firing their handguns , he said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 the gun jumped out of @entity17 ' hand because he was n't expecting recoil , @entity14 said , and @entity17 expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot @entity19 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 quoting @entity51 again , @entity14 said , " this is the slip and capture 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 under time pressure to address a perceived threat , his intention to draw his taser slipped off his agenda , so to speak , when it was captured and completed by a more well - rehearsed motor program 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 he was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 in his urgency , his concentration was focused exclusively on @entity19 ' back , where he intended to place the @entity65 darts 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 because of what 's called ' inattentional blindness , ' meaning that he was n't consciously paying attention to and registering it , he would n't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the @entity65 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 and in this case the weight of the gun and @entity65 are nearly identical 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " @entity14 was emphatic that @entity17 had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " @entity99 did not commit a crime 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 @entity99 was a victim , a true victim of slip and capture , " he said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " there 's no other determination i could come to 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " when they set up the undercover sting , police wanted evidence on camera 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 but when they recorded the operation targeting @entity19 earlier this month , cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran , and as he was fatally shot 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 the @entity112 released the video on friday 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 the shooting was an apparent accident , it has said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 in the last minutes of the video , @entity19 lies on the pavement with police on top of him 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 an officer calls for a @entity65 , but in place of an electric clicking sound , a gunshot rings out 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder

 an officer yells back at him 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder

 " he yells 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " f * * k your breath , " he said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 @entity14 defended the officer 's language , saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion , never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 the language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified , @entity14 said 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
 " one deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder

 " secondly , this is total stress 	sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a @placeholder
