( @entity2 ) just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp - size certificate issued by the @entity8 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 the certificate documents my successful completion of the @entity10 , or @entity11 , online course 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted @entity16 airspace in the country 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 although a " no - fly zone " over the @entity20 has long existed , the @entity11 airspace was developed to protect the @entity22 area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 the size of the @entity11 airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 an airspeed restriction begins at a 60 - mile radius from the center of @entity36 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 at the 30 - mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four - digit transponder code ( a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight ) 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 aircraft must enter the @entity11 through specific flight " gates " that are displayed on a standard aviation map 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with @entity11 restrictions 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the @entity11 airspace is already built into the system 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 being at the wrong end of an f - 16 missile is also a possible penalty 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from @entity92 landed a single - person aircraft on @entity95 grounds 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the @entity8 as a gyrocopter 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 a gyrocopter can not quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter ; it requires a short ground run for takeoff 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 and most gyrocopters are kit - built aircraft 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in @entity8 parlance 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 why is weight significant 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 below that weight , a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 in addition , to remain in the classification , the maximum designed airspeed ca n't exceed 55 knots 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average @entity133 goose 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 and the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 if it was actually tracked on a radar screen , the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 how much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 well , if it had been crashed into a building , i feel confident that the building would have been triumphant 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 if the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device , the weapon would have had to be relatively small 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 the engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 and lack of carry - on space is a definite issue 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 not that a review of airspace security measures is n't in order , but i would n't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
 as an airline pilot , i can say i am relatively confident that our nation 's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics 	@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @placeholder grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
