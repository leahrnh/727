( @entity2 ) an unmanned @entity4 spacecraft originally bound for the @entity5 will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere after flight controllers lost contact with it , @entity1 astronaut @entity0 said wednesday 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the spacecraft that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere in about a week , @entity11 , the @entity11 , said wednesday 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " @entity11 ( the @entity11 ) announced that the @entity15 will not be docking and will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere , " @entity0 said from the space station 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between may 5 and may 7 , according to @entity11 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the progress vehicle does not present any danger to the @entity5 due to a significant difference in orbit , @entity11 added 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the @entity4 space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the @entity5 and expects to launch a new progress ship in the third quarter of this year 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 @entity4 lost contact with @entity15 59 during a resupply mission to the @entity5 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the ship is now spinning out of control , @entity30 said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 even if @entity4 had n't lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for @entity15 to burn up re-entering @entity7 's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 according to @entity30 information on the progress resupply vehicle , " after the cargo is removed and before the progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the @entity7 's atmosphere 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " the cargo spacecraft launched successfully early tuesday from the @entity51 in @entity52 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 but after it separated from the @entity56 booster rocket 's third stage , @entity4 flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft 's systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , @entity30 said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " the spacecraft made another pass over @entity4 ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , " the @entity1 space agency said in an update 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 a planned rendezvous with the @entity5 six hours later was initially postponed to thursday but has now been canceled , @entity30 said in its latest update 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " docking has been called off for the @entity77 spacecraft , " it said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " @entity4 flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 additional information will be provided as it becomes available 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " few details have been forthcoming so far from @entity11 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 according to @entity30 , the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food , fuel , oxygen , spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 but the hitch will not put the six @entity5 crew members at risk , @entity30 said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " the spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) of the station , " a statement said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " both the @entity4 and @entity96 segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " that next flight , which will be the seventh @entity102 commercial resupply services mission to the space station , is not scheduled to take off before june 19 , @entity30 said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 meanwhile , @entity4 flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with @entity77 as it passes over @entity4 ground stations 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 @entity30 said tuesday that @entity4 flight controllers had " confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 " according to @entity4 state news agency @entity113 , six attempts to make contact were to be made wednesday 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 the @entity1 supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station 's environmental control and life support system , backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing , " all of which are replaceable , " @entity30 said 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 @entity1 astronaut @entity125 , from @entity126 , is the current space station commander 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
 @entity2 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report 	@placeholder : @entity4 flight controllers have been trying to make contact with the unmanned space freighter
