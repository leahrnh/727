( @entity5 ) according to an outside review by @entity8 professors , " ( a ) n institutional failure at @entity1 resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the @entity4 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " the @entity10 team concluded that " the failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the magazine 's managing editor , @entity18 , wrote , " we would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the @entity25 fraternity and @entity4 administrators and students 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " @entity28 : fraternity to ' pursue all available legal action ' the next question is : can @entity4 , @entity25 or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the @entity34 said in @entity35 v	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 @entity36 that " the elements of libel are ( 1 ) publication of ( 2 ) an actionable statement with ( 3 ) the requisite intent 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " " actionable " means the statement must be both false and defamatory 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 of course , the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the @entity47 to the @entity48 , but also the @entity49 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 true statements can not be defamatory 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 neither can pure statements of opinion , because they theoretically can not be either true or false 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 but the @entity1 article certainly purported to be fact , and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers " true 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " the individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 a private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 at first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the @entity10 report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 but that 's only half the battle 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 first , let 's eliminate @entity4 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the @entity34 has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : the government can not sue for defamation 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 there is no such cause of action in @entity105 jurisprudence 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 now the fraternities , starting with @entity25 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 a fraternity is not an individual , but a group 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were " of or concerning " the plaintiff 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 it sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 when the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is " concerning " the individual -- and groups generally can not sue 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 for example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 like all rules , however , there are exceptions 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 if the defamatory language is about " a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 " if i said , " the 1980 @entity148 infielders were a bunch of criminals " ( they were n't ) , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if i said that -- which i did n't 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 @entity25 would likely argue that the " small group " exception fits it perfectly : even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 on the other hand , @entity1 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid ( after all , the membership changes somewhat every year ) , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of @entity178 life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on @entity187 , but that such cases are rarely actually filed 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 that 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 so if your @entity193 calls you a loser on @entity195 , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 and since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on @entity187 live in their moms ' basements and are " between jobs , " these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the @entity4 situation is not your run - of - the - mill defamation case 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
 the university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases 	an outside review found that a @placeholder article about campus rape was " deeply flawed "
