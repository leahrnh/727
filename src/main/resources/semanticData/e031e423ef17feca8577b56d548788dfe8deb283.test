@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- two weeks ago , the @entity2 passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68 - 32 vote , with 14 republicans joining the @entity7 majority to send the measure drafted by a bipartisan " @entity9 " to the @entity11 - controlled @entity10 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 president @entity12 pushed for the @entity10 to quickly take up the measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country while bolstering security along the @entity20 border 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 the proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and overall border entry - exit controls 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 however , @entity10 @entity5 made clear wednesday they opposed the comprehensive approach of the @entity2 and intended to consider the issue in a series of bills that will take months to reach final votes 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 in addition , the @entity10 @entity11 caucus was deeply divided on the question of eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants , with some calling for a path to legal status while others opposed any kind of what they labeled amnesty for those who broke the law 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 while @entity10 leaders warned the party faced political harm if it failed to act on immigration legislation , a vital issue for @entity48 who comprise the nation 's largest minority demographic , the piecemeal approach and divisions over the legalization issue portend a messy and uncertain future for the issue 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 here are five reasons why : bipartisanship necessary in @entity2 , not the @entity10 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 a 60 - vote majority is needed to push major legislation through the 100 - member @entity2 , which means @entity59 and @entity5 usually have to work together to get anything substantive accomplished 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 the @entity10 , however , does not often require such a super-majority 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 as long as a simple majority sticks together , it can do virtually anything it pleases 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 mix that rule with increasing ideological orthodoxy and a decreasing willingness to compromise -- particularly within the conservative ranks of the majority @entity11 -- and you have a recipe for stalemate with the @entity7 - controlled @entity2 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 " passing any version of the @entity9 's bill would be worse public policy than passing nothing , " conservative pundits @entity72 and @entity73 argued tuesday in @entity74 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 " @entity79 can do the country a service by putting a stake through its heart 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 " in today 's hyper - partisan political climate , doing nothing is the easiest path for @entity79 to take and even a bragging point for tea party conservatives who came to @entity0 to shake up the status quo 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 while moderate @entity10 @entity11 leaders call for passing some kind of immigration legislation to avoid a potential political backlash , conservatives in the rank - and - file say such fears are unfounded as voters will reward @entity5 for opposing what they call a bad @entity2 bill 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill

 for a lot of @entity5 , though , the issue involves trust , not money 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 they remember the last major immigration reform effort , in 1986 under @entity11 president @entity128 , that also called for tightened immigration controls while giving three million undocumented immigrants legal status 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 they say the amnesty occurred but the tougher border controls did n't , leading to the much - worse situation today 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 now they do n't trust homeland security secretary @entity137 to secure the border 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 they also claim @entity12 's recent decision to delay implementation of part of health care reform showed the administration ca n't be counted on to fully enforce any law 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 by taking a piecemeal approach , @entity10 @entity5 hope to secure the tougher border security they seek before acting on a separate plan that could provide legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 in short , pass a border security bill now , and then come back to the legalization issue once everyone agrees the border is sealed 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 @entity59 reject such an approach 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 the conundrum of citizenship / legalization while the @entity2 measure provides a multi-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , @entity10 @entity5 made clear wednesday they remained split about 50 - 50 on the matter 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 reasons for opposing any kind of legalization range from punishing lawbreakers to political protectionism , with conservatives fearing that most immigrants given what they call amnesty and the eventual right to vote will lean @entity7 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 however , the issue of legalizing immigrants is broad and complex , creating lots of uncertainty 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 for example , the @entity2 bill would automatically give immigrants living illegally in the @entity115 temporary legal status as " registered provisional immigrants 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 " only when certain border security steps had been taken could they apply for permanent residency , or green cards , as a step toward potential citizenship in process that would take more than a decade 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 many @entity5 made clear they do n't want any kind of legal status for undocumented immigrants until the borders are secure 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 even those open to legalization do n't want it to include a path to full citizenship 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 the labels and definitions of legal status will be a major sticking point in the continuing debate , but also could be a source of compromise 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
 @entity10 majority leader @entity203 of @entity204 told wednesday 's @entity11 caucus meeting that children of undocumented immigrants brought illegally to @entity115 through no fault of their own should be provided a path to legal status , a position strongly favored by @entity59 	lack of trust is another obstacle , as @placeholder legislators remember the 1986 bill
