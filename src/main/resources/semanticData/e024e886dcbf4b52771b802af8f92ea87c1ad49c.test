 the opposition party , even when struggling in the polls , has traditionally been able to use these elections to mobilize its base 	he says @placeholder , @entity69 , @entity106 , @entity139 and @entity182 all suffered reverses

 the president had also been able to mobilize support for @entity37 intervention in @entity22 although @entity24 strenuously campaigned to convince voters that electing @entity40 would help in the war effort , warning voters that @entity19 " sought to take the choice of policy out of my hands and put it under the control of instrumentalities of their own choosing , " his argument did n't persuade 	he says @placeholder , @entity69 , @entity106 , @entity139 and @entity182 all suffered reverses

 the impact would be significant 	he says @placeholder , @entity69 , @entity106 , @entity139 and @entity182 all suffered reverses
 @entity57 @entity19 would successfully use their power and control of the committees to oppose @entity24 's request to ratify the @entity64 based on their opposition to the @entity37 entering into a @entity66 	he says @placeholder , @entity69 , @entity106 , @entity139 and @entity182 all suffered reverses
