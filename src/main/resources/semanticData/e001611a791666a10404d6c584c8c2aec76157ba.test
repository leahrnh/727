( @entity0 ) -- if the @entity1 has any real interest in obtaining justice in the tragic shooting of 18 - year - old @entity5 , attorney general @entity7 's announcement of a new civil rights investigation in @entity9 , @entity10 , ( population 21,000 ) was a step in the wrong direction 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the department 's ham - handed effort to improve the political " optics " of active federal involvement may , ironically , create the reasonable doubt that will ultimately clear the shooter , officer @entity19 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the @entity1 is likely to be impeding justice by proceeding prematurely with a federal investigation while local law enforcement authorities struggle with the facts of the complex and controversial case 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the @entity1 investigations ( there now appear to be two that have been officially announced ) are highly prejudicial to the local prosecutor 's presentation of the case to the grand jury 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the non-sequestered grand jurors who return home every night after scrutinizing evidence in the case are almost certain to hear of the existence of the new federal investigation 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 after all , the investigation was personally announced by the attorney general himself after the president publicly commented on the case 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the grand jurors might reasonably wonder why the federal government would open a civil rights investigation at the very same time they are hearing evidence about @entity9 's most famous homicide 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 some might reasonably wonder : is it possible that police officer @entity19 was motivated by race hatred when he shot and killed @entity5 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 why would the feds be investigating if that were not the case 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 although grand jurors are instructed to avoid press coverage of the matters they are investigating , such an instruction is obviously difficult to enforce with the tsunami of demonstrations , press coverage and presidential pronouncements rolling through @entity61 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the @entity1 should not add to the potential of improperly influencing a sitting grand jury by stirring up additional pretrial publicity as @entity7 did last week 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 notwithstanding the street conviction of officer @entity19 by the " @entity67 , do n't shoot " demonstrators and their allies in the press who appear to march in politically correct lockstep , a sworn grand jury is still evaluating evidence in the case 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the federal government should not be playing to the press and the crowd while this sensitive homicide investigation proceeds 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 there is plenty of time to commence a federal civil rights investigation and lawsuit when the facts of this case have been sorted out by the citizens who have pledged to evaluate the case in a fair and impartial manner 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 by all accounts , the grand jury presentation is occurring as grand jury presentations normally do in matters of this kind 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 i see no evidence that there has been any delay or improprieties in the current local grand jury proceedings that would justify immediate federal intervention 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the folly of @entity7 dispatching @entity104 agents to re-interview witnesses , many already interviewed by local law enforcement authorities , is apparent to any experienced criminal lawyer 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 multiple witness statements ( and in this case tv appearances ) create a wealth of material for criminal defense attorneys to add to their cross-examination arsenal 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 eyewitness testimony is often problematic in the best of cases 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 when even truthful witnesses make multiple statements about observations of a fast - moving event , there are often inconsistencies 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 experienced prosecutors attempt to keep a tight rein on the statements of their key witnesses to avoid inconsistencies being used by defense attorneys to create reasonable doubt 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 the @entity1 has blundered even further by conducting its own independent autopsy 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 in a case where forensic evidence relating to powder burns , angle of entry of the fatal bullets and other matters is of critical importance , the @entity1 helps to build reasonable doubt by ensuring three separate autopsy reports will be available for defense attorneys to scrutinize for contradictions and the creation of reasonable doubt 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 conflicting accounts of expert medical witnesses can be devastating to a prosecutor 's case 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 it is also highly unusual that the @entity1 would seek to devote its enormous resources to the investigation of a tiny 50 - person police force in charge of a city with a population of less than 21,000 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 there have been small - town investigations in the past , but they often occur in highly unusual situations , such as the lawsuit brought against @entity162 , @entity163 , a municipality alleged to be virtually owned and operated by @entity165 , the leader of the polygamist cult @entity166 who is serving a life sentence for sexually abusing children in his congregation 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 such investigations are virtually never done while an active , sensitive homicide case is under local grand jury investigation 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 i would imagine there are far greater problems in places like @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and probably 100 other large @entity189 cities that should be commanding the attention of the @entity1 rather than @entity9 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 and if the pattern and practices of small - town @entity9 require the scrutiny of the @entity1 , surely this can be done after the local authorities finish handling the most important matter facing the town , the @entity5 shooting 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 if the evidence supports an indictment , the officer deserves to be indicted and brought to justice 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 on the other hand , if @entity19 was under apparent attack and fired the fatal shots under the authority granted to police officers by @entity10 law , he deserves to be cleared 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 either way , the decision should be made on the basis of the evidence rather than political meddling by the @entity1 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
 while it is encouraging to see the administration finally has a " strategy " in place regarding the nation 's most highly publicized legal case , it might be better if it was one aimed at accomplishing justice rather than undermining it 	@entity225 : he says the probe is politically inspired and risks prejudicing the @placeholder case
