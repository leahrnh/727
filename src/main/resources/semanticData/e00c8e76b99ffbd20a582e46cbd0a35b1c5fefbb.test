( @entity0 ) -- it 's crazy golf on an insane scale -- a putting green swimming in a giant bowl of noodles and chopsticks , the @entity8 for a hazard , a fairway threading through @entity12 ruins and a panda - themed hole 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 @entity14 is getting into golf in a big way ahead of the sport 's reintroduction to the @entity19 in 2016 , and even its take on the mini version of the game is larger than life 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 " traditionalists will probably hate it , " says design guru @entity23 , principal partner in @entity24 , the company behind the 22 courses that make up the @entity28 complex in @entity29 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 " but this is real golf , with real clubs on real fairways , " he told @entity0 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 just about everyone has tried their hand at crazy or mini-golf , a scale - down variant of the game which has the ability to delight and infuriate in equal measure 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 usually situated at seaside resorts or other leisure locations , the prerequisites for success are a modicum of actual golfing skill , the ability to putt in a straight line or at unlikely angles off prominent obstacles -- and a large slice of luck 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 president @entity55 , who takes every opportunity to hit the fairways when not leading the western world , even tried his hand at crazy golf while on holiday with his family in @entity63 in 2010 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 making a par on his opening hole , he then had to watch as his nine - year - old daugher @entity66 made a hole in one , besting her dad in front of the gathered ranks of the world 's media 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 @entity55 might well be tempted to put his handicap on the line at the ground - breaking new course being constructed at @entity23 's @entity28 development 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 combining the wacky elements of mini-golf with the " grown - up " version of the game , the proposed 18 - hole layout would leave little chance of aces by nine - year - olds -- but still plenty of chances of humiliation for the average golfer 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 fantasy golf mindful of the impression that there is a " sameness " to the courses being churned out in their droves in the fastest expanding golf market in the world , @entity23 and his team wanted to come up with something that he felt would appeal to the wider @entity14 public and other visitors to the resort 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 so instead of bunkers , rough and trees , the players will be faced with a replica of the @entity8 winding its way the length of a 400 - meter par four hole 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 it also has a hole to rival the infamous " island green " seen at @entity114 in @entity63 , home of the the @entity118 @entity117 's @entity116 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 that tricky 17th sees the best in the world attempt to hit their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by water , and spectators delight in seeing the likes of @entity128 find the lake 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 at @entity28 ' new course , set to open in 2014 , the water is replaced by an 80 - meter wide noodle bowl with 50 - meter giant chopsticks 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 standing on the tee , players will not know whether to laugh or cry , and the degree of difficulty may not end there 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 @entity128 eyes long rivalry with @entity141 wind machine @entity23 is promising the addition of " man made " gale force winds on each tee , adjustable depending on the standards of the players and available by hitting a red button 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 there is a par - 5 threading its way through @entity12 ruins , while another green is created in the image of the " @entity158 " @entity156 in @entity157 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 another hole is styled after @entity14 's favorite animal , the panda bear 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 on a conventional golf course , the degree of difficulty is often dictated by which tee the player chooses to play from 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 leading professionals play from the tees furthest from the hole , while higher handicappers can opt to hit their first shot from much closer 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 on the @entity14 fantasy course , one of the par - 3s will give golfers the choice of hitting their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by lava rocks 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 in true mini-golf fashion , the other easier option at the volcano theme hole will let players hit towards a mound from which the ball will be whisked nearer the hole down a pipe 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 @entity23 and his team needed the permission of the owners of the complex before committing to the costly project , but @entity28 ' chairman dr	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 @entity192 is an enthusiastic backer 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 " this will be a fun alternative for families , novices and children on holiday , " he was quoted in the @entity194 edition of @entity195 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 only time will tell if @entity192 's faith in the project proves founded , but the @entity28 group has already established itself as a host venue of leading professional tournaments 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 last year the @entity29 development staged the @entity208 teams event for the first time , taking over from the @entity28 complex at @entity211 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 this year @entity211 was the venue of the prestigious @entity215 - @entity214 event , won by @entity217 @entity216 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
 the @entity219 hero conquered the conventional bunker - bound @entity221 course in 21 under par , but knowing @entity216 's reputation as a golfing trendsetter , he will probably be itching to test his mettle on @entity23 's new wacky creation at the first opportunity 	designers believe it could spark a new trend in @placeholder and wider market
