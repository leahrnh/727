 @entity19 was 6 months old when her dad was injured 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 during her first six months , he was just ok at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 but he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 then , our lives changed 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 it was december 21 , 2007 , three days before @entity19 's first @entity29 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 at our annual @entity29 with our friends , around midnight , my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 why 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes

 i went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 i could n't even hold her because the responsibility of being a " single parent " in the physical sense was so overwhelming , i shut down 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 every single minute of the day , i begged someone to fix my husband 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
 i remember one night in the @entity57 , the nurses got a rocker for me from the @entity59 and made me sit with @entity19 in @entity34 's room 	@placeholder taught them how to be a family again , @entity215 writes
