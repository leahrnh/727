( @entity1 ) it takes a village to raise a triathlete 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full - time triathlete , i 've been juggling training life with a full - time job , hectic commute and time with friends and family 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 with my @entity18 teammates spread far and wide , this was a solo effort 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 throw in a notorious @entity20 winter that refused to go gently into that good night , and i 'll admit it : i was not very diligent in getting all of my training done 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 " partner up , " the @entity23 status read 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 @entity26 , the founder of my local women 's fitness groups , @entity25 , posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 and so that 's what i did 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i 'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 so , i reached out to them to ask what they were up to 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 @entity39 , who 's training for her first @entity42 half - triathlon this summer , suggested a group brick workout at our local gym 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the @entity23 group and 10 of us met up on a cold @entity20 morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 that was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 a few weeks later , i traveled to @entity53 , @entity54 , to run a marathon 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i traveled to @entity53 with three phenomenal " fitspirations " : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the @entity62 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 seeing how much fun they 've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 swimming remains my weakest link 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i just learned to swim last summer 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 sometimes i forget that and do n't cut myself any slack or recognize how far i 've come 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 once my formal swim class ended in february i found myself seriously slacking on my swim training 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 enter my swim angels , @entity76 and @entity77 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 they took me out into @entity79 last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory " swim " ( which was really just wading ) 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 it was great to have them join me for a swim workout 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 and you know what was happening while i was partnering up 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 @entity90 was on the way 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 and that meant i could finally break free of my @entity94 bike sessions and hit the road 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i was lucky enough to connect with the @entity96 of @entity20 ( @entity97 ) for a series of novice rides they 've been hosting on local trails around @entity102 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 with two falls behind me ( hey , those clips take some getting used to ) , we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 riding outside with the wind whipping your face , chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and i 'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that i 've been lucky enough to find 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 there are so many others we keep me inspired , accountable and motivated 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 i 'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and i hope that i can help others do the same 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
 so when times get tough , partner up 	working out in a group of friends inspired @placeholder participant @entity124
