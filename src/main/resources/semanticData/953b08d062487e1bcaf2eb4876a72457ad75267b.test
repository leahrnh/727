 along with their parents , the girls relocated to @entity16 as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 heading south to @entity4 by way of @entity26 , the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey , gearing up to unleash their afro - pop sound to the world 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5

 @entity0 : hi guys , thanks for chatting with me today 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 what are some of your musical influences 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity36 : we love @entity49 , @entity50 -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the @entity53 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 we used to die for the @entity53 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 i love new artists now but i do n't know if it 's a nostalgia , but i remember 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 my mom used to pump whatever -- @entity56 , @entity57 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : you are working on your debut album now -- how 's that been 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : we 've been working with @entity62 -- he 's actually an actor 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 he was in " @entity63 , " " @entity67 , " and most recently he was in the @entity65 animation , " @entity66 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 " that 's what he 's more known for but his first passion is music 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 he 's an incredible producer , writer and singer 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 i just felt like he was always the missing piece 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 he brought everything together 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : so now that you 've found your " missing piece , " how would you describe your sound 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : our music before was experimenting with afrobeat sounds but now it 's more of a fusion ( of what ) we are inspired by 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 it 's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic @entity31 percussion 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 it 's a fusion of everything 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : and do you guys write the songs as well 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : the entire album was pretty much ( written and produced ) by me , my sister and @entity62 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 and when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity100 is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : what are you listening to right now 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : oh my @entity107 , there 's so many 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity36 : @entity109 with " chandelier 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 " @entity6 : i really love this new song -- i do n't know if @entity36 is going to agree with me -- but his name 's @entity113 , it 's called @entity115 ; i love it 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : as well as your music , you both work with the @entity119 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity119 ) -- how did you start your humanitarian work 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity36 : ever since we were kids we wanted to help @entity12 , we always talked about it 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 but we were like " what can we physically do 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 " we were doing some research and we called our mom and she said ' you know you still have family over there 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 there 's a refugee camp in @entity133 and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 ' and we did some research about @entity140 refugee camp , it 's a massive camp that has taken in @entity142 refugees , @entity12 refugees , @entity143 refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 everybody fled to @entity140 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 in the beginning ( it was ) pure advocacy talking about it on @entity151 and @entity152 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : but then you decided to " up your game " as it were 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity36 : yes , then we started a non-profit and we 'd do small benefit concerts in @entity159 and in @entity161 -- wherever there was a big @entity12 community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing , working with @entity119 in a capacity as a spokesperson 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 we headlined @entity167 at the @entity168 , as well as the @entity169 twice in @entity170 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 we felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets , the more we can do 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : we obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we 've been making these bracelets and necklaces called " @entity178 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 " wish stands for " @entity180 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 " we wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in @entity133 or @entity12 with women providing them with a sustainable income 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity0 : so what 's next for you two 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity6 : we 're actually in the mixing process right now 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 we still have a few ( tracks ) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 we want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 @entity36 : i do n't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we 're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for @entity12 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 i feel like now because we followed our dreams it 's like ' they 're not just refugees anymore 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 ' we do n't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to @entity12 and help rebuild -- it 's such a beautiful dream but not ours 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 in our culture , anything creative is not really respected or appreciated 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 but i feel like now but even with our new deal we 're still trucking along 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
 i feel like we inspire people 	@placeholder sisters , @entity36 and @entity5 , make up @entity5
