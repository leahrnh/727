 you know the one 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 it might as well have been stitched together with paper towels and duct tape , and it usually leaves the wearer 's behind hanging out 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " you 're at the hospital because something 's wrong with you -- you 're vulnerable -- then you get to wear the most vulnerable garment ever invented to make the whole experience that much worse , " said @entity16 , who lives in @entity17 , @entity18 , and has had to wear hospital gowns on multiple occasions 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 put another way : " they are horrible 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 they are demeaning 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 they are belittling 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 they are disempowering , " said @entity30 of @entity31 , @entity32 hospital gowns have gotten a face - lift after some help from fashion designers like these from @entity39 and the @entity40 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 but if efforts by some health systems are an indicator , the design may be on its way out of style 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the @entity50 was an early trendsetter 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 in 2010 , it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the ceo , who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 that feedback led to a search for something new , said @entity60 , chief experience officer at the hospital system 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon @entity64 , settling on a reversible gown with a front and back v - neck , complete derriere coverage , and features such as pockets , softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 patients " loved the gowns , " @entity60 said 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " people felt much more comfortable in the new design , not just physically but emotionally 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " in recent years , she added , " hospitals are looking at everything they do and trying to evaluate whether or not it contributes to enhancing the patient experience 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " it 's all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines -- fueled in part by the health law 's focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the @entity94 increasingly factors patients ' satisfaction into its quality measures , which are linked to the size of @entity100 payments hospitals get 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 sometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 but they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable , improving the quality of food served to patients or , as in this case , updating hospital gowns 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 ultimately , this focus leads to " a better patient experience , " said @entity113 , senior vice president of the @entity114 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the @entity116 - based @entity115 is in the process of updating its gowns , an initiative that began when the system 's innovation institute challenged students at the city 's @entity123 to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy , humiliating , indecent and itchy 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the process took three years , but last fall , the institute unveiled a new and improved version 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 it 's made of warmer fabric -- a cotton blend -- that wraps around a patient 's body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue , the hospital 's signature colors 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 patient expectations are part of the calculus 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 they " are demanding more privacy and more dignity , " said @entity148 , a product designer at the @entity40 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 when the institute tested his gown design , @entity148 said , patient - satisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the new gown " was emblematic 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 of an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital -- that they cared about me as a whole human being , not just the part they were operating on , " said @entity155 , who received a liver transplant during the time the redesign was being tested 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " that was the subtext of that whole thing , was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " but replacing the traditional design is no easy task 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 what patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams , meaning it must open and close easily 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 the gowns also need to be easily mass - manufactured , as well as efficiently laundered and reused 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 new designs , though , can be expensive 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 after @entity182 of @entity183 , @entity184 , switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage , costs went up $ 70,000 per year , said @entity188 , the facility 's chief supply chain officer , because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 beyond cost , more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear , said @entity198 , an assistant professor of medicine at @entity200 , who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal @entity203 , examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital - provided pants , instead of or along with gowns 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 often , doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay , but patients said they were never given those options 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly , and several doctors @entity198 spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open - backed gown during their stay 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 but the most common challenge is n't necessarily doctor expectations or costs 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 it 's navigating hospital bureaucracies , said @entity228 , president of the @entity230 - based company @entity229 , which designs and sells alternative gowns 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 in his company 's experience , hospital decisions are often made by committees , not individuals 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
 " there 's a lot of bureaucratic runaround , " @entity228 said 	patient satisfaction is linked to the size of @placeholder payments hospitals get
