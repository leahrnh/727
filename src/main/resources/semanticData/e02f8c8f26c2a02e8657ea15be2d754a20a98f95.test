every morning , @entity0 takes a trip around the world 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 with his own eyes , he studies artful , real - time images of life in @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 but @entity9 , a graphic designer , does n't actually leave his @entity11 , @entity12 , neighborhood , or even his front door 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 he just needs his phone and a digital portal called @entity17 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " it 's like taking a vacation every day , " said @entity9 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity17 is different than any other social network i 've been on 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " the freedom to share and connect with users across the globe is big part of what keeps @entity9 coming back to @entity17 , the wildly popular mobile photo sharing app , again and again 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 it 's that same appeal , @entity9 figures , which led to @entity31 's stunning purchase of @entity17 this week -- the single largest acquisition in that social network 's 8 - year history 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity31 is n't buying an app ; they are buying us , " said @entity9 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " they are buying a community 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity31 turned the tech world on its head monday when the social media giant laid down a whopping $ 1 billion in cash and stock options to gobble up @entity17 , a scrappy , @entity44 - based startup with just 13 suddenly very rich employees 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 @entity17 has seen explosive growth , racking up more than 35 million registered downloads in just 18 months 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 its community doubled in size the last five months alone -- turbocharged in part by the release of its long - awaited @entity53 version last week -- which propelled a million new users to sign up in the first 24 hours 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 on tuesday , propelled by a wave of publicity , the free app hit the # 1 spot on @entity60 's @entity59 for the first time ever 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 the billion - dollar question still looms , of course : why would the world 's largest photo - sharing platform fork over so much money for a tiny company that was evaluated at half that price 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 business analysts and tech geeks have speculated on the motives , but the heart of answer just might lie in the passion of @entity17 's most invested users 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 at its core , @entity17 is a remarkably simple way to share mobile photos 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 users snap pictures , enhance them with filters that add an arty or vintage look , and share them with their followers 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 as on @entity85 , users can follow other @entity86 , whose photos then show up in their streams 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 users can " like " or comment on photos , as they can on @entity31 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 @entity91 : my year through the lens of a really smart phone but to many of its most loyal users , @entity17 is much more -- a creative outlet , a place to be inspired every day and a platform to make new friends 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity17 has changed my life , " said @entity101 , who has more than 100,000 followers on the network 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " i love being able to share my world with people i do n't know but [ who ] inspire me 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " but @entity101 , a @entity44 - based photographer who says she has landed gigs by connecting with clients via the app , is worried a massive influx of new @entity31 users could spell the end of @entity115 's charm 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " maybe @entity17 has played its role , " she said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " maybe it 's time to move on 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " the blogosphere in recent days has been full of similar complaints from @entity17 users worried that @entity31 will sell their personal data or pollute their photo streams with ads	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 photographer @entity123 is more cautiously optimistic 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " let 's wait and see what happens before we pass judgment , " said @entity123 , who also lives in @entity44 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " of course i would be very angry if @entity17 became something i no longer want to use , " he said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " but there 's no reason to suspect that yet 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity123 believes there could be a silver lining as the service skyrockets in popularity : improved features such as adjustable filters , perhaps , or an easier way to keep track of talented users 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 with more than 800 million users , @entity31 knows a little something about scale 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 and @entity17 's rapid growth has created its own bumps along the way 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 early adopters have complained that @entity17 's " popular page " has become nearly impossible to reach and is often filled with photos that people did not take themselves -- too many semi-clothed teens , for example , or @entity151 tributes 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 longtime @entity86 gripe that some users are there merely to gain followers , not necessarily to join what @entity156 describes as a " thriving community of like - minded people thirsty for photography 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " " i 'm just as much a viewer as i am a photographer , " said @entity156 , a web developer from @entity161 , @entity6 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " and that 's the same with everyone , so there 's this constant feedback loop 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 it almost feels like this collaboration in becoming better photographers 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity156 wants to keep his @entity31 and @entity17 accounts , and communities , separate 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " the problem with my @entity31 is it 's all over the place , " @entity156 said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " i 'm connected to colleagues , family , and friends , but i feel like i 'm forcing my photography on @entity31 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity177 , a lawyer in @entity178 , does n't have a @entity31 account 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 nor does he want anything to do with it 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " it 's always a new challenge to put up with change , " @entity177 said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " what i fear is @entity17 losing its simple approach 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 it 's a very pure , social , exchange between people who share the same passion 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity9 , the @entity190 , also is concerned about @entity31 's vast reach 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity17 is a very small team 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 they are nimble and fast and can make decisions , " he said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " my fear is that now there will be more layers to this creative process 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity199 , a graphic designer in @entity44 , bought his first @entity200 partly so he could download @entity17 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 he admits he can easily spend four hours a day interacting with the app 's visual community 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " i do n't really get excited about posting photos to @entity31 , " @entity199 said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " but that 's exactly how i feel when posting to @entity17 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity199 says that by treating his phone like a camera , he is more open to exploration 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity17 reawakened my creativity in a lot of ways , " he said 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " i 've learned to react to that spark -- when i see something just walking around -- and not just dismiss it 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 here is this little app that 's connecting us all [ in @entity44 ] and inspiring us to go out and explore this city we live in , to wake up at six in the morning to go capture a sunrise 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " @entity199 said he 's not considering quitting @entity17 at this point , in part , because " there 's noting else out there compares 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " not everyone agrees 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 some @entity17 users have already made the jump to other platforms 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 @entity227 - @entity226 , a web developer living in @entity228 , said the @entity31 deal was the " final push 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " he closed his account monday , leaving behind more than 2,000 followers , and now shares his mobile landscape photography on @entity234 , a @entity236 - based competitor to @entity17 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 @entity226 is not the only respected @entity190 to flee the app this week 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 but fears of an exodus , for now , appear greatly exaggerated 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 still , even the most optimistic @entity17 users are left with wounds 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " what happens the next time a tool is created that taps in to my interests 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " wondered @entity123 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " am i going to feel the same way 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 or can we assume that all great things will eventually be owned by @entity31 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity60 , or @entity251 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " whatever the motives for the deal , few users seem to be holding ceo @entity255 and the rest of the @entity17 team in contempt for selling out 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 in the end it 's a billion dollars , " said @entity123 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 " i do n't blame [ @entity17 ] 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 there 's no black and white 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
 it 's just a lot of bread 	@placeholder bought photo sharing app @entity17 for $ 1 billion on monday
