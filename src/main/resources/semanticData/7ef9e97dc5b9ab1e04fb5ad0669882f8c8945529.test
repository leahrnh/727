( @entity2 ) @entity1 driver and @entity4 championship leader @entity3 stole pole position for sunday 's @entity6 from teammate and fierce rival @entity8 in dramatic fashion 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 @entity3 took first place on the front row on the last lap , beating @entity8 by a slim four hundredths of a second margin 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 frenemies the two former friends have enjoyed , or rather endured , a heated rivalry since falling out last season and @entity8 's annoyance at @entity3 's last ditch success was obvious 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 the @entity21 appeared upset as he left his car and refused to shake @entity3 's hand 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 he did , however , find time to congratulate fellow @entity21 driver @entity26 , who will start in third after the @entity29 driver surprisingly won the @entity31 gp two weeks ago 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " i do n't actually mind him having more ( poles ) , " a nonplussed @entity3 told @entity32 after the session 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " he can have the trophy for most poles 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 as long as i have the trophy for winning -- that 's all that matters 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 ultimately qualifying is not the end of the world 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " " i am frustrated " in the post qualifying press conference @entity8 appeared more magnanimous , but still shocked by @entity3 's last minute burst of speed 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " i was frustrated , i am frustrated , yeah , " @entity8 admitted 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " it 's so close and of course i would have wanted to have pole today 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 it 's just four hundredths and that makes it even more annoying because it 's just very , very close 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 a lap is never 100 per cent perfect and four hundredths is really the blink of an eye 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " @entity56 will join his teammate @entity26 on the second row and will be looking for a repeat of @entity29 's performance in @entity31 , which shocked @entity1 and @entity3 in particular 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 huge support but @entity3 has been quickest all weekend and will enjoy a surprising amount of support in @entity62 , a track the @entity65 driver has always thrived on 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " have you seen the banners that i have here 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " he told the assembled press when asked why he liked racing at @entity62 so much 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 " the support i have here 's pretty unreal 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 i just like the track 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
 i guess it just naturally suits my driving style 	@entity8 refused to shake @placeholder 's hand afterward
