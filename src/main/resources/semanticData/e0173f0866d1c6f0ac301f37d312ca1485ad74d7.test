( @entity0 ) -- here 's a question that seems to be lost in the debate over the @entity4 independence vote scheduled for september 18 : if @entity4 votes to secede , does that open up a spot for another country 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 and if so -- @entity4 , can we take your place 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 i realize that @entity13 fought a bloody war of independence from @entity16 in the late 1700s , but our rifts have healed over the past 240 years 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 in 2013 , the @entity18 reported that @entity16 topped @entity13 's list of favorite nations , in a near - tie with our beloved northern neighbor , @entity23 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 in the past few years , as @entity13 has degenerated into political and economic chaos , it has become increasingly clear that we would be far better off if we apologized for our revolt against the @entity27 and requested to rejoin the @entity28 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 there are four main ways @entity13 would benefit from unification with the @entity28 : @entity32 have better health , less inequality , excellent manners and -- let 's face it -- a superior culture 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 let 's improve our quality of life by joining them 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 want to live longer 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 then let 's become @entity43 â € ” the 50 - state replacement for @entity4 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 @entity32 have greater longevity than @entity13 , and the @entity28 health care system , while far from perfect , is indescribably better than ours 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 in my visits to the @entity28 , i 've noticed that just about anyone who can afford private health insurance buys it , which allows @entity32 to supplement their free , government - provided health care 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 that means there 's a baseline of care that every person receives , and if you want something faster or better , you pay for it yourself 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 meanwhile , @entity13 's needlessly complicated arrangement of government - and employer - provided health care , in a clumsy compromise with insurance companies , costs way more than other developed countries ' while producing worse results 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 next , @entity28 is a more equitable society 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 although @entity13 has a higher gdp per capita , most of us -- that is , the 99 % -- are not happy because of our ever - widening wealth gap 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 @entity32 have less inequality , and their median incomes ( unlike ours ) have risen in the past decade 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 @entity13 's middle class used to be the richest in the world ; now we 're overtaken by @entity23 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 unless you are the 1 % in @entity13 , chances are your wages are stagnant 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 living a good life -- owning a house and a car and being able to support a family -- seems like a struggle , especially when compared with your parents ' generation 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 americans could also learn a few lessons from the @entity32 when it comes to good manners 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 when i took students with me to film news reports of the 2012 olympics in @entity96 , we dealt with unimaginable crowds on the street , in the shopping centers and on the @entity100 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 did we hear groans of exasperation when we accidentally bumped into @entity32 in @entity103 while trying to get a better view of @entity105 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 never 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 did we see looks of frustration when our cameras accidentally knocked into innocent people in @entity110 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 not even once 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 this patience and politeness stands in stark contrast to the attitude in big @entity13 cities , where cab drivers curse at you just for your mere existence , and @entity120 agents at @entity13 airports compete for the title of @entity123 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 finally , @entity13 would benefit from a closer association with @entity28 's culture 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 the country that produced @entity127 , the world 's best storyteller , has also given us some of the best entertainment and media of modern times 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 our imitation of @entity28 television ( e	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
g	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 " @entity134 " ) speaks for itself 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 has any band ever topped the @entity136 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 and nothing against @entity138 and @entity139 , but the @entity140 produces some of the best publicly funded journalism , putting much of the world 's radio and television news programs to shame 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 the world respects the @entity28 , in part , because the @entity140 is so trustworthy 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 that 's called soft power 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 but wait , you ask 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 what 's in it for the @entity32 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 three things 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 natural resources ( oh so much land 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 ) , the majestic @entity155 and a sport called " @entity157 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 " they 'll love it 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 so remember , @entity13 , if @entity4 votes for independence on september 18 , let 's improve our lives by asking to take their place -- if not officially , then at least in spirit 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 we hold this truth to be self - evident : @entity32 have a superior society 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 @entity13 claim we do n't want a monarchy , but deep down , we 're just as hungry as our @entity28 cousins for news about @entity172 , princes @entity173 and @entity174 , and those adorable royal babies 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
 @entity16 , will you take us back 	@entity4 is voting on a referendum for independence from @placeholder on september 18
