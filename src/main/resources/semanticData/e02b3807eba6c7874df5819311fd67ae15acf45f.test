( @entity0 ) -- when @entity2 introduced the @entity3 last january , the biggest surprise was n't the actual product 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ( many shrugged and called the @entity3 a " bigger @entity5 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 " ) it was the price : just $ 500 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 nobody expected that number , perhaps because @entity8 has traditionally aimed at the high end of the mobile computer market with macbooks marked $ 1,000 and up 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 and perhaps we were also thrown off because @entity8 execs repeatedly told investors they could n't produce a $ 500 computer that was n't a piece of junk 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 but @entity8 did meet that price , and the @entity3 is n't junk 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 the @entity3 is still the first , and best - selling , product of its kind 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 competitors , meanwhile , are having trouble hitting that $ 500 sweet spot 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity26 's @entity25 tablet is debuting in the @entity27 with an $ 800 price tag 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ( to be fair , the most comparable @entity3 is $ 730 -- but there 's no $ 500 @entity25 planned , and the lack of a low - end entry point will hurt @entity26 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ) @entity33 's @entity32 , with a relatively puny 7 - inch screen , costs $ 600 without a contract 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 why is it so hard to get to a lower starting price 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 and how was @entity8 able to get there 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity39 of @entity40 suggests it largely has to do with @entity8 's retail strategy 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @entity3 directly to customers 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 that 's advantageous , because if the @entity3 were primarily sold at third - party retail stores , a big chunk of profit would go to those retailers , @entity39 reasons 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity8 has partnered with a few retail chains such as @entity52 and @entity53 , but those stores always seem to get a small number of units in stock 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity39 rationalizes that the true purpose of these partnerships is probably to help spread the marketing message , not so much to sell @entity3 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 " the company can swallow the bitter pill of hardly making any money from @entity3 sales through its retail partners because it can feast off the fat profits it makes when customers buy directly through its retail outlets and the web store , " @entity39 says 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 " however , companies like @entity26 , @entity71 , and @entity33 have to make all of their profit by selling their tablets wholesale to retailer partners 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 " the retail advantage is a reasonable theory , but @entity39 neglects to mention the high overhead costs that @entity8 must pay handsomely for each of its 300 stores 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 to @entity39 's credit , @entity8 running its own stores does present clear benefits : the customer outreach is enormous , and of course , in @entity8 stores , @entity8 products do n't have to compete with gadgets sold by rivals on other shelves 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 but when we try to decipher why the @entity3 costs $ 500 , we have to consider the sum of all parts , not just the retail strategy 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity8 is the most vertically integrated company in the world 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 in addition to operating its own retail chains , all @entity8 hardware and software are designed in - house , and @entity8 also runs its own digital content store , @entity101 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 designing in - house means @entity8 does n't have to pay licensing fees to third parties to use their intellectual property 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 for instance , the @entity107 chip inside the @entity3 is based on technology developed and owned by @entity8 ( not @entity110 , @entity111 or @entity112 ) 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 the operating system is @entity8 's own , not something licensed from @entity115 or @entity116 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 why do you think @entity71 bought @entity118 to make the touchpad 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 @entity71 wanted ownership of a mobile operating system in - house to take control of its own mobile destiny and stop being so reliant on @entity115 ( which , to this day , does n't have a credible tablet strategy ) 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 on the @entity101 media platform , @entity8 takes a cut of each sale made through each of its digital storefronts : the @entity131 , ibooks and @entity101 music and video 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ibooks still has a long way to go before it 's anywhere near as big as @entity137 , but the @entity131 and @entity101 are the most successful digital media stores of their kind 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 at the end of the day , the @entity3 might be worth well above $ 500 for all we know 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ( @entity143 estimates made by component analysts such as @entity145 are n't very useful because they fail to measure costs of r&d and other factors 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 ) it 's most likely that @entity8 can afford to absorb the costs of producing and selling the @entity3 because of the tenacious ecosystem backing it , and also because it has such tight oversight over every aspect of the company to control price 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 that 's what it all boils down to : ecosystems and control 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 competitors are struggling to match the $ 500 price point because they are n't as fully integrated as @entity8 , in terms of retail strategy , a digital content market , hardware and software engineering -- everything 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 as @entity2 famously put it one day , " @entity8 is the last company in our industry that creates the whole widget 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
 " competitors are having trouble beating the @entity3 widget 	@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @placeholder directly to customers
