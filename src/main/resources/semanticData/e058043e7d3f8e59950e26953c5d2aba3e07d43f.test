( @entity0 ) -- if president @entity4 's inaugural address was any indication , his second term will be a doubling down of the progressive , big government agenda 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 with that in mind , here is some advice for conservatives and the @entity13 for the next four years of @entity4 's presidency : do n't blame the @entity13 leadership first and foremost , if we are to prevail , we can not afford to continue firing upon and wounding or maiming our own soldiers and officers 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 we need everyone in the fight 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 it is more difficult to be in a position of governance , such as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , than a journalist , pundit or conservative talk show host 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 trust me , i 've been in both arenas 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it

 unlike those who operate solely in the arenas of commentary , opinion and philosophy , @entity13 in @entity38 bear the responsibility and burden of actual governance , where ideological purity must often yield to compromise 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 much of the blame placed at the feet of @entity13 leadership by many in the party or the commentariat lies not with the party or its leaders but ultimately , as in all things with a democratic republic , with the choice of the people 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 opinion : guns were last straw for me with @entity13 face reality @entity64 aptly described conservatism as the politics of reality 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it

 such views are the products of our education system and the movies , music and entertainment young @entity88 consume 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 we must change those cultural institutions before we can truly change our political institutions in the long term 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
 the roots of our cultural and educational outreach must be as far reaching as the left 's 	@entity220 : the @placeholder people voted in big government , and they will be punished for it
