( @entity1 ) the cover - up is often worse than the crime 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 @entity3 stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his @entity7 documentary series " finding your roots " because the actor @entity10 put pressure on him 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 @entity10 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , @entity16 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 @entity10 said , in a statement posted on @entity18 , that he " did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 i was embarrassed 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 " and @entity3 later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more " compelling television 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 " but providing a window into the importance of slavery 's past to @entity33 's present should never just be about what makes for good television 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 @entity3 missed an opportunity 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 and @entity10 's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth ( an impulse , he said on @entity18 , he regrets ) is surprising 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 last month , @entity10 lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the @entity42 by testifying before @entity43 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 he is n't shy about aligning himself with causes and issues 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 what more could he do if his instinct is also to tackle issues closer to home : the legacy of slavery in his own family tree and how it is possible -- necessary -- to reject the racism passed through generations even today 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 he should have shown the courage to stay in an uncomfortable place 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 what a teachable moment for the country 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show

 he could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry , if privacy was what he wanted 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 the irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if @entity72 's emails had not been hacked and if @entity3 had n't written to @entity73 , ceo of @entity72 , for advice 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 in the leaked exchange , @entity73 advised : " i would take it out if no one knows , but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 " @entity3 acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest " would be a violation of @entity7 rules 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 " then he does it anyway 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show

 " for @entity10 's " @entity99 " segment , he substituted a @entity101 ancestor instead of the slave - owning one 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 if @entity3 thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with @entity73 ; @entity90 could have given @entity10 what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong @entity10 's story was 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show

 " @entity10 says , " it gives me a kind of sagging feeling to see , uh , a biological relationship to that 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show

 this is the kind of enlightened approach @entity3 and @entity7 should have been interested in facilitating 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
 @entity175 ' lack of comfort in talking about slavery , race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president , we are still , as a country , far from post-racial 	@entity201 : @placeholder and @entity3 scrubbed segment about @entity10 's slave - owning ancestors from tv show
