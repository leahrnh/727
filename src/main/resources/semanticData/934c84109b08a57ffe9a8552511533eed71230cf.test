 " you are also telling girls they are unworthy , unwanted and that it 's un-cool to be smart and confident 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 " what happened next shows that parents , aided by social media outrage , may have more leverage to combat gender stereotyping in our culture than they realize 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters

 " it is sometimes difficult to hear negative feedback but the message was clear and we intend to act upon your message , " the statement read 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 " most importantly , @entity27 does not condone sexism in any shape or form and does not design products to shine a negative light on females or males 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters

 around the same time , @entity2 heard from another follower about an issue with toms and wrote about it on her site 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 on the normally progressive retailer 's web landing page for kids were photos that some parents felt played into gender stereotypes 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters

 " so , here 's my question : are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment , or more a sign of the power of parents 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 or are they a mixture of both 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 how to @entity221 # @entity220 @entity2 said there 's no doubt that companies are in business to protect their bottom line , and that will always be a motivator 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters

 " the success with @entity27 and @entity238 and other wins we 've had in the past is an example of the power of parents ( moms and dads ) and children 's advocates aggregating their voices to say , ' enough is enough 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 ' " @entity12 said it 's a sign of the power of parents becoming " more aware , reactive and using social media to make their voices heard by companies that market to children 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 " she added , " one voice can be dismissed ; the hailstorm of voices collectively can not be ignored so easily 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 " it is clear , from these two examples , that parents using their voices online and with their wallets can encourage companies to change 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 there 's no question that raising awareness about stereotypes helps , said @entity2 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
 " if companies are n't paying attention by now , they most certainly should be 	a mom of two got upset when " @placeholder " fabric did n't include the two female characters
