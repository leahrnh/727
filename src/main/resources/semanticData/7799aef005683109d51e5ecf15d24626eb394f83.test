 it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place 	political sparring continues in @placeholder over the deal with @entity7
 not a single centrifuge is destroyed 	political sparring continues in @placeholder over the deal with @entity7
 not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly 	political sparring continues in @placeholder over the deal with @entity7
