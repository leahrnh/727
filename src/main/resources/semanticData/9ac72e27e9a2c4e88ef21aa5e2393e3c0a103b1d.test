@entity4 ( @entity5 ) a year after @entity3 became a household name in @entity1 , using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge @entity9 and its affiliates for jihadist adherents , @entity1 prosecutions of would - be recruits have exploded 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 the flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since january -- is a sign that complicated , manpower - intensive investigations begun when @entity3 started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 but they also highlight the unique challenges that @entity3 poses in comparison with @entity9 , which has attracted fewer @entity1 - based recruits 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 like a new rock band storming the music charts , @entity3 has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , law enforcement officials said 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 the group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 at first , most of the recruits were self - starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming @entity3 propaganda from @entity41 videos and other social media 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer - style videos , some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who @entity3 leaders decide does n't comport with their medieval brand of @entity53 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 but once those initial @entity60 recruits arrived , living in the self - declared @entity3 caliphate spanning parts of @entity57 and @entity58 , they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 in @entity65 , nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to @entity1 @entity69 , who turned up fighting with @entity3 in @entity57 in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the @entity71 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 " each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here , " a senior @entity1 counterterrorism official said 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 it 's a phenomenon observed in @entity80 and other @entity82 nations , where clusters of young people have been lured to @entity3 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 and the @entity3 recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than @entity9 has had 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 a decade ago , that group 's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard - to - reach areas of @entity93 and @entity95 's tribal region 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 few westerners went through the trouble 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 @entity99 men allegedly trying to join @entity3 highlight role of @entity1 recruiter today , @entity3 occupies much more accessible territory , mostly reachable through @entity103 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 @entity105 's airport has easy connections to @entity107 and much of the rest of the world 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 from there , @entity103 's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to @entity57 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 the informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials , who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 " it 's harder for us to pick up on , " the @entity1 counterterrorism official said of the peer - to - peer recruitment , which is well below the radar 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 how @entity3 is luring westerners before @entity3 , investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 @entity9 recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect @entity53 holy lands 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative @entity53 histories , including @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity1 officials said 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 in contrast , @entity3 takes a somewhat secular approach , portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt @entity148 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 and people attracted to @entity3 ' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor , educated to dropout , male to female , teenaged to middle - aged 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 there are signs @entity60 recruits have risen to high levels in the @entity3 organization , with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda , counterterrorism and intelligence officials said 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 the @entity164 is proper , with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 and while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts , it also means that @entity1 authorities do n't see the lure of @entity3 receding any time soon 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
 " we are opening cases quicker than we are closing them , " the @entity1 counterterrorism official said 	@placeholder benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , officials say
