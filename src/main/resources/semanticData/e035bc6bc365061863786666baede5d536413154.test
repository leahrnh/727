 the other is @entity13 , who is currently contracted to strugglers @entity14 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 @entity10 told @entity15 that the increasing need for drivers to attract big - money sponsors has made it harder for talented youngsters to break through , especially with @entity2 battling to gain a foothold in @entity0 's sporting spectrum 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 @entity23 takes championship lead after third straight win " after @entity13 and @entity10 , i really ca n't see an @entity0 driver for the next , i would say , eight to 10 years , " @entity10 said ahead of this weekend 's @entity26 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " @entity2 has become all about money 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 it never was earlier , you could find a slot with just talent 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " the @entity2 teams have decided that even if you 've got talent , let 's have your checkbook as well -- bring in five , 10 , 20 million dollars and let 's give you the seat 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " according to @entity39 , it could take a figure such as legendary cricketer @entity41 to spark genuine interest in @entity2 among @entity0 's 1	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
2 billion inhabitants 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " @entity0 needs heroes , @entity0 needs superheroes like @entity41 , " he said 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " @entity13 and @entity10 have certainly given the sport , or our sport at least in @entity0 , the slot that it desperately needed 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 @entity2 has helped 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " @entity50 handed new @entity52 contract @entity53 's @entity23 won last year 's inaugural race at the @entity55 , near @entity56 , but @entity39 fears interest in the event has dipped since then 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " there 's been a massive drop in buzz , i do n't know why , " he said 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " after the first year , we had a sellout crowd in year one of 95,000 people , but year two there has been a dip 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " i think we will end up with 60,000 spectators in the stands 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 ( in @entity0 ) nobody 's used to be parked in long queues just waiting to get to a @entity2 event , having to find passes -- it 's a very sanitized atmosphere 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " despite @entity39 predicting a drop in attendance figures , @entity75 's @entity74 says 60,000 is still a sizable crowd compared to other dates on the @entity2 calendar 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " the first year you are always going to get a lot of spectators and a lot of interest , " he told @entity15 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " it needs to be put in perspective as well -- 60,000 spectators is a huge number of spectators 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " places like @entity92 did n't get half of that number 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 they might not have as many spectators as last year , but they have still got a hell of a lot more than many other race tracks 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " the cheapest ticket for the track over the weekend is $ 61	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
53 in a country where there is widespread poverty 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 @entity74 said the prohibitive ticket prices are a direct result of the millions of dollars which must be paid to host an @entity2 grand prix 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " it 's a problem all over the world , " he said 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " you ca n't charge hundreds of pounds for a grandstand seat and then complain you have n't got enough spectators 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " the tickets prices are astronomical 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 the fees paid to host a grand prix are many millions , so in order to try and recoup some of those funds the tickets prices are high 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " however , @entity39 hopes @entity2 can develop in @entity0 despite the challenges faced by its race organizers 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " i do hope that economically and financially it remains viable , " he said 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " there is a contract between the gp group and @entity2 until 2015 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " beyond that i do hope that we can sustain it , and if not maybe @entity2 will start to change their approach to rights fees and things like that 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 " it 's very high at $ 40 million , it 's very high for a country like us , but as we start using the facility that is built for it for other uses , like concerts , national events , i think it will be fantastic to try to make this with a really long - term plan 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
 i gather it will work 	@placeholder 's son @entity10 is one of just two @entity0 to have competed in the sport
