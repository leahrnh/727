( @entity0 ) -- yes , i said it , and i will say it again : on wednesday night , sen	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 @entity4 was a hero for civil liberties 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 i love and respect president @entity6 , and i was honored to work for the @entity6 @entity7 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 that said , the executive branch of the @entity11 government today has an extraordinary level of power 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 progressives like rep	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 @entity15 and conservatives like @entity4 can all agree it has a disturbing license to wage a never - ending , ill - defined , even un-defined " war on terror , " including the use of drones 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 i applaud @entity4 for standing up and calling attention to an important and vexing set of questions 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 now , let me say to my conservative friends : do not get too excited 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 i still believe @entity4 is as much a villain on civil rights as he was a hero this week on civil liberties 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 the rev	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 @entity28 's successful strategy was to force the federal government to intercede not just with states , but also private businesses that denied equal treatment 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 @entity4 would have robbed @entity28 's strategy of its teeth , because he does not believe the commerce clause of the @entity37 grants the federal government the right to protect individuals from racial discrimination in the marketplace 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 in fact , he once said businesses should be able to turn people away based on the color of their skin 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 also , please do not get me started on his votes against the @entity48 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 nor on his opposition to a woman 's right to make private medical decisions 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 nor on his desire to cut @entity54 and @entity55 , while preserving tax loopholes for the wealthiest people ever born 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 but we can not be so balkanized as a nation that we refuse to say " well done , " when someone does right , even if we disagree on everything else 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 we are bigger than that 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 the idea of using military drones inside @entity11 borders should trigger concern and scrutiny from all points on the political spectrum 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 to my progressive friends : the argument should not be whether we trust this president not to abuse that kind of authority 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 the next president might 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 if a @entity78 president refused to rule out killing @entity11 citizens on @entity11 soil without due process , we progressives would be marching down the street 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 we must be vigilant and consistent 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 there is a risk that any @entity7 will develop delusions about its own power 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 the amount of information that top officials get is so overwhelming , and the level of responsibility so crushing , that there is always the temptation to think , " we know more than the public 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 " it is a shame that it was @entity4 , not progressives and liberals in the @entity98 , who led this filibuster 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 not only that , we can admire that @entity4 used the filibuster the way it should be used 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 he did not simply stick a post-it note on a door somewhere and leave town , solely to gum up the government 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 too many @entity78 have done that during this president 's time in office 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 he said that this is an important issue , and we should be talking about it more -- repeatedly , for 13 hours 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 that 's not a stunt 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 that 's the way the filibuster is supposed to work 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 if you want to see a stunt , pay more attention to the excessive abuse of the filibuster over the last four years 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 fortunately , attorney general @entity124 sent @entity4 a commendable letter ruling out strikes on noncombatant americans on @entity11 soil 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 but at the end of the day , i still do not believe the @entity11 public has a clear understanding of the extent and limits of the drone program 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 for example , what about @entity11 overseas -- and what about the hundreds of innocent civilian lives lost to terrifying drone strikes around the world ? getting rid of unilateral kill lists will not elevate our moral position if we continue to be responsible for innocent deaths 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 in addition to the lives lost , we inflict tremendous trauma on children who witness these attacks , and unmeasurable psychological damage on parents who never know if this day will be their last 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 decent and fair - minded @entity11 should focus not only on drones that target @entity11 , but also on drone strikes that shock our conscience 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 we need to have a national conversation , and that is what @entity4 started on wednesday 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 no matter what you think of his other views , we can all agree that this conversation can not end here 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 	@placeholder : @entity4 deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
