( @entity1 ) it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the @entity3 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a @entity11 pilot alive 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 so what can and should we make of the organization 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 and although it 's important to start with the caveat that @entity3 is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of @entity3 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 first , @entity3 is clearly about religion -- its version of radical @entity33 -- but it is also about power 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of @entity3 is made up not by a group of @entity3 zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from @entity43 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 an internal @entity3 report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the @entity49 weekly @entity48 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 next , @entity3 presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 , who believe they must fight the @entity71 to secure their own survival and strength 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the reality is that that @entity68 cause is going to endure for some time 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the @entity76 has been successful in its tactical battles against @entity3 and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in @entity69 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 but the @entity68 of the region will remain in rebellion and the @entity68 - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that @entity3 will be able to capitalize on this chaos 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 in the long run , @entity3 might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so - called caliphate 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by @entity3 suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to @entity71 rule are growing disenchanted 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 in this respect , @entity3 is like other radical @entity3 groups , such as the @entity102 -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the result is ever - increasing repression 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the group simply slaughters its way to control 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 of course , one of the big questions has been : is @entity3 a threat to the @entity116 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the group 's leaders declare that it is 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their @entity121 enemies , on building a caliphate in @entity69 and @entity70 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 they understand , of course , that to be @entity127 no	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 1 power -- the @entity76 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the @entity76 will come to the @entity135 and fight them on their terms , on their terrain 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in @entity76 , their main focus is not to come here -- they want @entity76 to go there 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat @entity3 poses , the group has changed the nature of terror 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the leaders of @entity3 have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the @entity162 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 and @entity3 does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn - off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
6 billion @entity177 -- who seek revenge , glory and gore 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
 unfortunately , as long as those young @entity177 men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to @entity3 and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month 	@entity191 : @entity3 has thrived because of a local @placeholder cause in @entity70 and @entity69
