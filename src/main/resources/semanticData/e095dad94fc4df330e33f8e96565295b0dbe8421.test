@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- they are some of the biggest names in @entity5 , but even @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have had their fair share of casting calamities they would rather forget 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 @entity12 sabotaged some auditions for parts he did n't want 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " why not be nude even if it is a children 's theatre 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity2 's @entity17 has managed to persuade the cream of @entity5 to confess their tales of audition woe 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 the stars shudder at the memory of waiting in line , frantically trying to memorize lines handed to them moments before , all the while being assessed by critical strangers 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 @entity27 recounts attending 50 or 60 auditions before getting a part and @entity30 told @entity31 he " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " while @entity34 remembers a cutting personal assessment : " you 're not pretty enough 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " here are some of their worst moments : @entity40 " @entity41 : @entity42 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " " @entity43 " " there was one that started out terrible , which was where i had to go to a disused tax office in @entity51 [ near @entity1 , @entity0 ] very early in the morning and put on very tight velvet flared loon pants and a pair of crocodile four - inch - heeled platform shoes , and wear a sort of very small top that did n't meet my trousers , hair extensions and i had to karaoke to ' @entity61 ' by @entity62 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 it 's a very lonely place 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 and i was 45 at the time 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity7 " before @entity65 , " " @entity64 " " i have had so many bad auditions 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i have fallen on my ass 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i have made a complete fool of myself 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i auditioned for @entity69 once and i was so starstruck i could n't even speak 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then i got kind of nervous and i paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 you just have to forgive yourself and keep going on 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity12 " @entity76 : the spy who shagged me , " " @entity79 " " i 've had some bad auditions for some tv movies that were shooting in @entity0 where i just did n't want to be in them and offered them more obtuse [ performances ] 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i like to think of it as performance art	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i did n't sabotage it , i was just woefully inappropriate , you know 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i just thought , ' why not be nude even if it is a children 's theatre 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity34 " being @entity91 , " " @entity92 , @entity93 " " you would n't believe some of the comments , assessments 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 but , they 're really not meant personally 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 like for example , ' you 're not pretty enough 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' for them it 's just a fact 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 but for you it 's like , ' oh my @entity102 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i have to live with this 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' you get a thicker skin about it , which you should because it is n't meant personally , but it 's such a personal profession that you kind of have to get used to getting critiqued on things that you should n't even care about 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity8 " @entity109 , " " meet the @entity110 " " the most famous casting director from @entity93 , i was lucky enough to get an audition with her in the ' 60s 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 she did all the plays , all the @entity113 plays 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 she is sitting across the desk saying her lines , and i am saying mine , and she stops and says , ' come here 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 bring your chair here , right next to me 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' and i say , ' why 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' and she says , ' because i ca n't hear you , and you have never been on the stage or on @entity113 , and you are going to have to reach the last row 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' i said , ' yeah , i know 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i have been studying acting for about seven years now , but i 'm not on @entity113 now , i 'm just sitting in front of you 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' so , she said , ' i know , but i could n't hear you 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 that 's why i asked you to sit next to me 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' i said , ' okay 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 can you hear me now 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' i was getting so angry 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 well , at that point she said , ' speak up , ' and i screamed as loud as i could , every line after 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 she called my agent and said , ' if you ever send that maniac around here again i will never see another one of your clients 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' i really lost it 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 @entity31 " @entity138 , " " @entity33 " " i left the casting of ' hostel : @entity141 , ' which @entity30 [ @entity30 ] was a producer on to go and audition for his movie [ ' @entity33 ' ] and it was just a room with a camera 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 he was n't even there and i was like , ' where 's @entity30 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' they go ' he did n't leave his house today 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' anyways , i blew it 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i did terribly and @entity30 called me and starts making fun of me 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 he was like , ' you were so bad in your audition , but i 'll give you a callback 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 come on 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' @entity154 " @entity155 , " " @entity156 : @entity157 " " i auditioned for ' @entity155 ' with @entity158 and @entity159 and when i went into that audition i was eight months pregnant , so there is always kind of a lasting impression that i was playing this military officer with this gigantic belly 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 obviously , it turned out well because i got the role but there was something quite odd about it 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity169 " @entity170 , " " @entity171 " " i remember auditioning for one play , and the girl was awfully short and we were holding the book in our hands and i almost could n't see her 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i knew i was n't going to get that part , i tried to make myself smaller and smaller so i could be closer her size and that did n't happen 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 " @entity180 " transformers : @entity181 , " the taking of @entity182 1 2 3 " " i met [ ' transformers ' director ] @entity186 in his office in @entity188 for an hour and a half he had me running , jumping and diving all over his office and his furniture freaking out like i was reacting to robots , which is the strangest audition i have had by far 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 i left the room completely drenched in sweat and all i could say was , ' i better get this part 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
 ' it worked out and the stuff we did in the room was the stuff we did on set 	@placeholder " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33 "
