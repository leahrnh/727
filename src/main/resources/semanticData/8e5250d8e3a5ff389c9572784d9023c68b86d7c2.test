 it is difficult to date the gospel itself 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 one of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity52 : where can we get a good translation of the @entity27 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters

 one suggestion is @entity59 's " @entity58 : @entity11 and the @entity60 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 " that book also has good introduction and discussion materials 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 one thing that is worth adding is that the @entity27 is not actually called " @entity65 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters

 where did she go 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 who last saw her 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity3 : this is one of the great mysteries about the character 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 she is so prominent at the end of each of the @entity82 , and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the @entity4 , but there is nothing 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 she is not mentioned in @entity89 , or in @entity91 's letters , or anywhere else 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 one possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 but if that is the case , it is surprising that the @entity27 writers pay so much attention to her in their @entity104 and @entity105 narratives 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 another possibility , and we touched on this in the episode , is that @entity18 died not long after the events narrated in the @entity110 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 perhaps she was a wealthy , elderly widow 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @ turnbullteacher : would n't @entity111 writing in the second century have written if @entity11 was married or not 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity3 : that 's a good question 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that @entity11 was married and @entity116 ( died 215 ad ) takes for granted that @entity11 was not married 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 when the " @entity118 " was published in 2012 , it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of @entity11 being married from as early as the second century , but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @ anna585858 : do you think @entity18 is a nickname or reference to @entity18 's hometown 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity3 : it 's a good guess that " @entity18 " refers to @entity129 , and so her name would refer to her hometown , just as @entity11 the " @entity134 " is from @entity133 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 there are other characters in the @entity4 who are identified by their hometowns 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 for example @entity140 and @entity141 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 you are right , though , that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with @entity129 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @ @entity145 : why was the @entity27 left out of the canon of 66 biblical books 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity3 : this is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 the @entity27 is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early @entity6 works 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 but in any case , the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with @entity156 , @entity3 , @entity157 and @entity158 , all of which are written by the end of the first or , at the latest , the beginning of the second century 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 further , the @entity27 's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical gospels 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @ @entity167 : where is it ( said ) that @entity11 had a wife 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 @entity3 : there are no ancient texts in which @entity11 had a wife 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 the closest we get to the idea is the @entity176 in which @entity18 is described as @entity11 ' " companion , " one of three women who always " walked with the @entity179 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
 " the same @entity27 says that @entity11 used to kiss her often , but we do n't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point 	@placeholder is one of the @entity211 's most complicated characters
