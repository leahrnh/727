 the flight data recorder , or " black box , " was found thursday by recovery teams that have spent days since the march 24 crash scouring the mountainside in the @entity16 where the plane went down 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 a statement from the @entity10 on friday said its teams had immediately begun to investigate its contents 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 " the initial readout shows that the pilot present in the cockpit used the autopilot to put the ( airplane ) into a descent towards an altitude of 100 ( feet ) then , on several occasions during the descent , the pilot modified the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the ( airplane ) in descent , " it said 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 " @entity37 is continuing to establish the precise history of the flight 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 " evidence from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder , recovered swiftly after the crash , had already led investigators to believe that @entity6 acted deliberately to bring down the plane , killing all 150 people on board 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 and prosecutors in @entity49 said thursday that an analysis of a tablet device retrieved from the 27 - year - old 's apartment in @entity54 revealed that he had researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the @entity58 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 the correspondence and search history on the device demonstrated that the co-pilot used it from march 16 to march 23 , @entity54 prosecutor @entity59 said 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 the search history was not deleted and also revealed searches concerning medical treatment , the prosecutor said 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 investigators have focused on @entity6 's health as they try to establish his motivation 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 but the missing " black box " was expected to yield important evidence about the plane 's final minutes 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 a female police officer digging by hand for clothes in a ravine that been searched previously found the flight data recorder thursday afternoon about 8 inches ( 20 centimeters ) below the surface , @entity1 prosecutor @entity75 told reporters 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 usually white with florescent orange , this discovered recorder lived up to its name as a black box because fire had darkened it with ashes 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 in addition , out of more than 2,000 dna samples collected from the crash site , lab workers have isolated 150 dna profiles , @entity75 told reporters 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 " that does not mean we 've identified " the crash 's 150 victims , @entity75 said -- noting the recovered dna still must be compared with dna submitted by the families of those who died in the crash 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 authorities have also found 470 personal effects at the site , according to @entity75 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 that number includes 40 cell phones , though all those were badly damaged 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 @entity75 cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones , given their condition 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 that view is consistent with @entity2 officials ' claims wednesday insisting that two publications , @entity49 daily @entity116 and @entity2 @entity117 , were wrong to report that cell phone video showed the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 noting he 's made a criminal request to @entity49 authorities but is for now conducting his own investigation , the @entity2 prosecutor said he is tasked with an involuntary homicide investigation 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 but @entity75 noted that @entity6 made voluntary actions -- such as guiding the plane toward the mountain and reducing its speed to prevent alarms from going off -- and was " alive and conscious " to the very end 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 a @entity134 official government official with detailed knowledge of the investigation said that @entity6 's actions amount to " premeditated murder 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 " while cautioning that there are still many holes in understanding @entity6 's motivation , the disclosures about his internet searches show that he planned to do what he was going to do , according to this official 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 calls for crash avoidance technology it is becoming increasingly clear to investigators that @entity6 was " very afraid " he would lose his license to fly because of his medical issues , a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity3 on thursday 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 it 's already emerged that @entity6 had battled depression years before he took the controls of @entity156 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 but the law enforcement source said that after a severe depressive episode in 2009 , @entity6 relapsed with severe depression and stress in late 2014 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 in the weeks leading up to the crash , @entity6 was shopping doctors , seeing at least five , perhaps as many as six , the source said , as he kept going from one doctor to the next seeking help , including from a sleep specialist 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
 he was prescribed powerful medication , though it 's not clear he was taking it 	@entity2 investigators : flight data recorder reveals @placeholder acted deliberately to crash plane
