 @entity0 : you 're both reaching new milestones in your careers , how does it feel 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity5 : i feel like i 'm exactly a decade behind @entity3 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 he 's at twenty years in publishing , i 'm at ten 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 when i came in there were a group of writers who are standard bearers 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 you look at what they 're doing and think this is what i have to go chase 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 the first book i wrote that was published , my editor was telling me go read @entity3 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i said " i am " and he said , " try again 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 " ten years later i 'm still getting that advice from everyone 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 what @entity3 's been able to sustain for twenty years is almost unprecedented in terms of the quality of the books continuing to improve 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it 's just remarkable 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 hopefully my books are improving 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 one of the ways i find motivation to improve is looking at someone who is already at a high level and continues to get better with each book 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 that 's really what you want to emulate 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity3 : i do n't think i was one who looked at anniversaries and numbers much , but for some reason this one was significant for me 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 when you 're starting out you never believe that you might accomplish writing twenty - five books in twenty years 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it 's really bizarre to even contemplate 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 twenty years was significant as well because of what happened in @entity95 in 1992 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 my first book was published in january of that year so it was kind of a new world opening up to me 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 a few months later the city was torn apart by riots after the @entity103 trial 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i really did weigh all these anniversaries and years when writing this book 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i think it 's the first time i ever really thought about that 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 the book 's about the death of a journalist and during the riots i almost got killed 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 that 's something i worked out in a lot of my books 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 so that all played into it , there 's a lot of nostalgia , all of it was really important to me and i never really had this kind of stuff inspiring me before 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity0 : how have you both remained so prolific 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity3 : what @entity5 has done is remarkable 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 my first book was n't published until i was 36 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 now he 's almost thirty and on his ninth book 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 you know i 'm bragging about how i 'm on book 25 and he 's probably thinking about 75 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 that 's hard for me to imagine , what he 's doing 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i feel like i 'm making up for lost time 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 that 's part of what drives me 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 for some reason , i do n't know why i had this idea , maybe because i was 36 when my first book was published , but i wanted to write 36 books before i 'm done 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i love the play " @entity141 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 " in the movie , @entity143 says , " always be closing 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 " i feel the same way 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 for me closing is writing , always be doing it 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity5 : i knew at a young age this is what i wanted to do 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i look at the fact that i got an early start -- that was a real blessing to me because it gave me a greater opportunity to tell more stories , hopefully , and at the end of the day that 's what i want to do 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 what i love is the writing , it 's not having written 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i like the process of it 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity0 : do you view writing as a competition or camaraderie 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity5 : i 've always felt an incredible amount of generosity from the time i showed up , people going out of their way to help me who did n't have to 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it seems like there 's a really good spirit of brotherhood , especially in crime fiction 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 in terms of competition , anytime i read a book that i think is really good , like " @entity22 , " i love it and i 'm rooting for @entity3 as a friend but there 's also a spark of , this is a better book than what i wrote and now i 've got to try and catch up with that 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 for me , that 's the greatest motivation to improve is to see really good writers continue to get better and continue to pull farther away from you 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 you 're always chasing the rabbit , and that 's a good thing 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity3 : there 's always been a good mix of camaraderie and motivation 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 we 're lucky in the genre we pursue , it 's so big 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 we 're not worried about , that book is so good it 's going to take sales away from me 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 you just do n't see that 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 readers love to read good stuff , so there 's no reason to really be competitive 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity0 : do you prefer writing a stand alone novel or a continuing series character 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity5 : what i like about writing a stand alone novel is you 're starting with a fresh world and fresh characters 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 part of what i love about writing is that journey of discovery where it 's all new to me as well 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 this is my fourth stand alone in a row and i am beginning to get a little bit of an itch now to take a longer ride with a character , to get to know them a little better 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 in " @entity35 " i really fell in love with those characters , there was an emotional connection there that i do n't think i 've had in a while 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it made me think it would be nice to stick with the characters for a little bit and see what happens 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 my next book will be a stand alone but after that i 'm thinking about trying to take a little bit longer ride 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity3 : a series character like @entity20 can be a trap but it 's a good trap to be in 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 this idea that it 's an unfinished story with more to say 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i guess i never write standalones 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 even if i come up with a new character , i often bring them back 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 the last time i introduced a new character was " @entity248 , " and now that 's going on seven or eight years 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i 'm already writing my next book and it 's @entity250 , but i kind of feel like creatively i need to come up with something new pretty soon 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity0 : if you could steal an idea from the other @entity3 what would it be 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity3 : i would be an esoteric thief 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 maybe it 's the comfort of age but i look at what @entity3 has done with writing different kinds of genres 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i 've been more straight laced , straight crime 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i 've never broken away ; all my stuff is in the same vein 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it takes a certain amount of courage and confidence to pop out a book that 's going to be compared to @entity269 instead of @entity270 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 so i would steal that kind of creative courage 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity5 : courage is one word for it 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 @entity275 might be another 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 i 've been shamelessly stealing from @entity3 for years 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it 's his ability to say so much with one simple sentence that has what i call layers of depth 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 it 's the words beneath the words 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 he does that every book , time after time after time 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 he 'll lay out a beautiful line , @entity287 thinking on the surface what is a very simple thought or observation but it has ripples to the past , the present and goes deeper to the core of the character 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 he has the ability and the confidence to let it ride on top and know that the reader will get it and feel that impact 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
 that 's an incredible gift and that 's just great writing 	@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @placeholder may be the " future " of the genre
