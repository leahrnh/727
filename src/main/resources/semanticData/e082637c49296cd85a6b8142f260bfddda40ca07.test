( @entity0 ) -- in the three days since @entity1 crowned its 11th official princess and people got a glimpse of the " new " @entity5 -- @entity1 's doll version of the fire - haired heroine of the @entity10 - winning animated film " @entity11 " -- there 's been much uproar 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 the princess - ified @entity5 aimed at the merchandising market is hippier , her neckline a little more plunging and off - the - shoulder than it was in the film 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 her features are softer 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 and is that lipstick she 's wearing 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 @entity1 was quickly taken to task by many , including the film 's writer and co-director @entity23 , who called the makeover a " blatantly sexist marketing move based on money " that strips the character of her place as a " better , stronger role model 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 something of substance , not just a pretty face that waits around for romance 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 " the implication , of course , being that pretty girls ca n't be role models 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 or have substance 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 let me be clear : as a female heroine , @entity5 was revolutionary , and we should have more like her 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 increasingly , we do 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 @entity1 's @entity44 -- the female warrior from its 1998 animated film -- was one , in fact 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 and indeed , in the film , @entity5 's best features were the ones that had nothing to do with her body , her face or her outfits 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 she was outspoken and unafraid , independent and empowered 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 she stood up for herself and others 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 she carried a bow and arrow , and she knew how to use it -- far more skillfully than the boys , besides 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 she was perfectly subversive as a princess for all the reasons that had nothing to do with her looks 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 ( though let 's be honest : her wild mane of red hair could not have meant to be anything but ravishing 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 ) at the same time , she was undeniably sexy , if you consider strong women sexy -- and do n't we 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 dolls are built on the notion of fantasy 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 they are not true to life -- but even less true , by nature of their technical limitations , than cartoons , which benefit from animation that 's often so precise as to appear real 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 as toys , dolls take on many of the characteristics that the child playing with them chooses to impart 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 part of parenting is to help children explore the many options that life offers , to tap into the vast reaches of their imagination , but also to know the difference between what 's fiction and fantasy and what 's reality 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 and dolls , perhaps more than most toys for children , are not meant to be taken at face value 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 otherwise , we 'd be making the case for legions of 8 - year - olds to be running around suburban @entity108 with bows and arrows 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 and that 's not , i do n't think , the point @entity23 was trying to make in her movie 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 the reality is that in deciding to make some changes to @entity5 , @entity1 probably was thinking about money 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 how corporate @entity108 works is a conversation for another day 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 but more poignantly , moneymaking is how @entity1 , and others , help new films get made -- and yes , even the progressive ones 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 @entity1 's princess @entity5 does n't take away from the positive message that " @entity11 " put forth : lipstick or no , she 's still the same girl inside 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 but @entity23 's argument does -- by bringing the focus back to @entity5 's looks in a way that 's exclusionary of all else 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 the fact is that " babes " can be worthwhile role models , too , and no less so than those women whose looks are more rough and tumble 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 what 's sexist , polarizing -- and most damaging -- is the suggestion that women can be only one or the other : pretty or powerful 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 vulnerable or strong 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 @entity137 wearing or substantive 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 these are incorrect messages that serve to confuse and contain 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 instead , the message should be about how these days , women can be many things 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 girls -- and boys -- are listening 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 	@entity147 : @entity1 retooled princess @entity5 from " @placeholder " movie as " babe " for doll
