( @entity1 ) @entity0 is the end 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 beautiful friend , the end 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the @entity11 ' @entity10 in december 1969 , the @entity13 shootings in may 1970 or @entity15 's 1972 re-election 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 for " @entity16 , " the " end of an era , " as its slogan has it , begins sunday 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been " @entity16 " cocktails and " @entity16 " museum exhibits and even " @entity16 " presidential references 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 @entity34 , the creative director played by @entity35 , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 its subjects have taken the show to heart 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 in march , a " @entity16 " bench was unveiled in front of @entity46 's @entity45 , where the fictional firm of @entity16 & partners has its headquarters 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 the end of a tv series brings with it some risk 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 " @entity55 , " " @entity16 " creator @entity54 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut - to - black finale 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 on the other hand , " @entity16 's " former @entity60 stablemate , " @entity61 , " was saluted for an almost perfect landing 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 speaking of landings : the last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in july 1969 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 though @entity54 and his cast have been typically tight - lipped -- @entity54 even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 what 's going to happen 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 here are some educated guesses 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 with the ' 60s screaming towards their conclusion , " @entity16 " probably wo n't jump ahead much 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 the latter half of 1969 included the @entity80 murders , the @entity81 , a @entity46 mayoral campaign and the @entity84 moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 who knows 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 the show might even mention the @entity90 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 it would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late @entity93 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 of course , @entity54 might have a different idea ; he 's from @entity96 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 " @entity16 " is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the ' 60s themselves 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 the old orders are falling apart : white - shoe wasp firms like @entity16 giving way to the ethnic pace - setters such as @entity104 ; grimy @entity46 replaced by sunny @entity105 ; the " @entity107 " generation butting heads with the " @entity110 " cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid - state @entity114 world 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 it 's all an ad agency can do to keep up 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill - fitting merger between @entity16 and former rival @entity123 and @entity124 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 though the agency survived , it 's now without @entity16 ( @entity127 ) and under the ownership of ( real - life ) @entity132 titan @entity130 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 that 's not a recipe for long - term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , @entity140 ( @entity141 ) and perhaps even @entity142 ( @entity143 ) -- to look for an exit 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 @entity145 -- the wisecracking executive played by @entity146 -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 he 's suffered two heart attacks 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 he drinks to excess 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 he 's never grown up 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 bet on a sudden and shocking departure 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 on the other hand , @entity152 's star has continued to rise ( much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind @entity154 ) 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 she left @entity16 once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 if @entity152 , played by @entity160 , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 that is , if she 's still interested in such an old - fashioned tradition 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 in recent seasons , @entity34 's ex-wife , @entity165 ) , has lost herself amid all the turmoil 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 she sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband @entity170 ( @entity171 ) has been far more supportive than @entity34 , he 's a busy man 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 and @entity172 , @entity34 's daughter ( @entity172 ) , is proving to be a handful 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 on the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 in recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 you could see her hitchhiking to @entity81 , or at least dropping out of school 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late - night rides with @entity185 -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 @entity15 is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding @entity34 of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the @entity195 campaign that began the series 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 no fool , he had seen this day coming years before 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
 he 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado - colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone 	" @placeholder 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
