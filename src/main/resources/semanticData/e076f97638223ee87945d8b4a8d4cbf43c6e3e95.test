( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 surely faces the most thankless task in world football after @entity4 clinched a historic treble on saturday , adding the @entity6 to the @entity8 and @entity9 crowns 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 the @entity10 , who was named as @entity4 's next coach back in january , will take over a team that has conquered @entity13 and its domestic rivals , with the 3 - 2 win over @entity16 giving the departing @entity17 a perfect sendoff 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 the 68 - year - old is widely expected to retire , though he has also been linked with a return to @entity21 -- where he won the @entity8 in 1998 -- after guiding the @entity22 to 45 wins from 53 matches this season 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity16 never looked like inflicting @entity4 's fourth defeat of the campaign after going 3 - 0 down after an hour , with @entity28 netting a first - half penalty and striker @entity30 scoring twice against his former club in what could prove to be his final game for @entity4 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity35 @entity34 struck twice to give @entity16 hope in front of more than 74,000 fans at @entity40 's @entity39 , but @entity4 held on for a 16th victory in the knockout competition to become the first @entity44 side to complete such a treble 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity1 helped @entity46 become the first @entity48 club to win a hat - trick of titles in 2011 , but was unable to follow that up last season before standing down 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity46 completed this season in style on saturday , beating @entity54 4 - 1 to equal @entity21 's points record of 100 and beat the club 's best goals tally -- scoring 115 in 38 @entity59 games 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 striker @entity60 , @entity61 and young defender @entity62 all netted within 16 minutes , while veteran midfielder @entity63 curled in a spectacular second - half effort before substitute @entity65 pulled one back for @entity54 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity67 came on to make his final appearance for @entity46 , with the @entity70 defender being released despite making his comeback in april following a liver transplant 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity74 's future is also in doubt , with @entity46 having signed @entity76 forward @entity77 from @entity78 last week 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity54 manager @entity79 is also on the move , being widely expected to join @entity82 club @entity81 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 the @entity83 announced last month that he is leaving the @entity48 club , which ended the season in sixth place and reached the @entity8 quarterfinals 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity89 's three - year tenure at @entity21 ended with a 4 - 2 win at home to @entity92 , which left his second - placed side 15 points behind @entity46 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 the @entity97 coach , who is expected to rejoin @entity82 club @entity98 , was booed by large sections of home fans before the match -- though others held banners thanking him -- and he was surrounded by photographers every time he ventured from the dugout 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 he has divided opinion at the @entity107 after being unable to follow up last season 's title , or deliver @entity21 's long - awaited 10th @entity13 title -- and the @entity112 final defeat against @entity113 was the last straw as he agreed to leave by mutual consent 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 despite @entity89 's apparent dressing room rift with former captain @entity118 and other key @entity48 players , @entity21 defender @entity116 said the 50 - year - old deserved respect 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 " we respect his decision , the club 's too , and wish him well 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 we all know that we have taken a major leap in competitiveness and we knew we could have achieved a lot , but due to small details or bad luck it was not to be , " @entity116 said 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 " he has had his successes and failures , as we have all had , but he gave his all and defended @entity21 above everything 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 " @entity134 snatched a place in the @entity8 qualifying rounds , winning 1 - 0 at @entity137 to ensure @entity138 missed out after a 4 - 3 defeat at @entity140 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 striker @entity141 scored all four goals for mid-table @entity140 as visiting @entity138 dropped to fifth place despite a second - half double from forward @entity145 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 the defeat relegated second bottom @entity137 , while @entity148 also went down despite winning 4 - 2 against @entity149 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
 @entity150 moved out of the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win over @entity152 , but @entity153 ended the season at the foot of the table after losing 3 - 1 at home to third - placed @entity113 	@placeholder final victory gives @entity4 a hat - trick of titles this season
