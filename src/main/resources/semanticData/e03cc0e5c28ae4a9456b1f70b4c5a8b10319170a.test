( @entity0 ) -- tuesday 's election marks the end of an epic , historic campaign season that included witches , rallies for sanity , the @entity7 and a journalist handcuffed by a campaign 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 from @entity11 to @entity12 to @entity13 , candidates have spent more than ever , fought more than ever , and given us an election cycle of firsts 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 but there is another first no one is really talking about : the surge of @entity21 and @entity22 veterans running this year 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 on tuesday , 27 veterans of @entity21 and @entity22 will seek national office 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 this is nearly four times the number of veterans of those wars currently serving in @entity28 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 twenty - five are campaigning for @entity31 seats and two are running for the @entity33 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 eighteen are running as @entity35 , nine as @entity36 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they are as ideologically diverse as the electorate they hope to represent and share only one agenda item : their desire to continue their service 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 this wave of veterans -- the @entity44 27 -- is the beginning of a much larger movement developing in @entity48 politics and society 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they represent the next greatest generation of troops , who are committed to serving our country long after they get home from war 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 whether they win or lose in their campaigns , for those of us who have served , their initiative is inspiring , especially after a decade of war during which recent veterans have often been portrayed as either villains or victims 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they are a dynamic group of young men -- unfortunately , no female veterans of @entity21 or @entity22 are running in this cycle -- who are familiar with a little crossfire 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they definitely know how to fight back when attacked 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and their bios read like something out of a movie 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 are just a few in this wave 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity81 served two tours in @entity21 as a @entity87 , taught at @entity88 , and is running for @entity28 in @entity89 in @entity91 's home district 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity82 served as a @entity92 in both @entity21 and @entity22 and is up for re-election to @entity28 in a part of @entity95 with a huge concentration of active duty troops 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity83 , an @entity98 pilot renowned for saving a @entity100 , @entity101 , woman from a knife - wielding attacker , returned from his third deployment to @entity21 in may 2009 and is running to represent a congressional district in @entity105 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and three - star navy adm	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity84 is trading in his command of a carrier battle group supporting combat operations in @entity21 and @entity22 for an opportunity to tackle the @entity33 representing @entity110 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 on the front lines , @entity111 served to a different degree than 99 percent of @entity48 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they saw firsthand the enormous cost of @entity48 's decision to send young men and women to war 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they were tested , they served with honor -- and they survived 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 now , they 're ready to put their military values and skills to use in a new kind of battle 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 as veterans , they know the ramifications of foreign policy decisions , the struggles for quality health care coverage , and the challenges of getting a college education 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they also know how to make tough decisions under pressure 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and they are looking for that next mission that allows them to keep serving 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 they represent new blood , but they 're not the first generation to make this transition 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 our democracy is rooted in this historical precedent 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 since @entity155 first set aside his rank of general to seek office , declaring " when we assumed the soldier , we did not lay aside the citizen , " veterans have long been part of a tradition of political service in this country 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity164 and @entity165 created a wave in @entity167 , as many former warriors used the @entity169 to earn their college education and transition into public service 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 are just a few of the veterans in our nation 's recent history who carried their oath to serve from combat to @entity190 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 but @entity111 hoping to take the oath of office comes at a critical juncture for our country 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 the @entity48 public has never been more disconnected from the costs and consequences of war 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and @entity167 is no exception 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 despite the nation being immersed in two wars , the veteran ranks on @entity190 are rapidly disappearing 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 many @entity164 and @entity165 vets have died or retired , and there are only three @entity206 vets currently serving in the @entity33 ( @entity182 , @entity181 and @entity180 ) 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 after tuesday 's election , there is a significant likelihood veterans will hold less than a fifth of the seats in @entity28 -- a sharp contrast from 1969 , when veterans held a record 75 percent of the seats in the wake of @entity164 and @entity165 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 when polls close this week , @entity111 might not all capture seats , but they do represent an important sign of things to come for our country 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and troops thousands of miles away in @entity21 and @entity22 will have an eye on them 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 after tuesday , there is no telling how many of the 2	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
1 million troops deployed to @entity21 and @entity22 , as of june 2010 , will end up in @entity28 in the years to come 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 but if history is any guide , the country should expect quite a few 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 and likely one or two in the @entity31 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 	@placeholder says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices
