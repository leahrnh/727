 the radiation astronauts would face on a round trip would be comparable to getting an abdominal ct scan " about once every five days , " said @entity18 , principal scientist for the @entity14 - led @entity19 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 the findings were published thursday in the journal @entity22 , based on data from a device called the @entity25 that took readings during @entity3 's trip to @entity4 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 the spacecraft was similar to one that would carry humans , and scientists were interested in measuring galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the trip 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " it is clear that the exposure from the cruise phases alone is a large fraction of ( and in some cases greater than ) currently accepted astronaut career limits , " they wrote 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 @entity18 and his colleagues found voyagers could be exposed to between 554 and 770 millisieverts of ionizing radiation during the trip , depending on the level of solar activity 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts

 shielding that would completely block those rays would be " meters thick " and too heavy to be used aboard a spacecraft , said @entity90 , a radiation health expert at @entity14 's @entity92 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 @entity93 , @entity14 's deputy director for advanced exploration systems , said the space agency is working on engines aimed at cutting the trip time by the 2030s , when it hopes to send humans to @entity4 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 but it will take " many years " before those systems are ready , he said 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 in the meantime , @entity93 said engineers could try to limit travelers ' exposures by designing a spacecraft in such a way that it provides more protection 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " ideally , we 'd like to arrange the configuration of the habitat to provide radiation protection by surrounding the crew with water , which contains a lot of hydrogen , " he told reporters thursday afternoon 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " that 's the most effective shielding that we know of 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " a one - way ticket to @entity4 astronauts would also be bombarded with solar energetic particles , which get accelerated close to the sun as a result of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that shoot portions of the sun into space 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 @entity93 said @entity14 is already developing personalized shelters that would protect astronauts from a solar storm and hopes to test them " in the next few years 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " another possibility would be to figure out how to generate a magnetic field around the spacecraft that mimics the one that protects @entity55 from the worst cosmic radiation 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " it would require a lot of power for electromagnets , but it does have promise , so we 're donig some really advanced studies on that 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " a question of physics , a question of biology the problem has two sides : physics and biology , @entity18 told @entity0 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 on the physics side , the radiation is in line with expectations 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 " as it stands , what we measured is pretty much in line with predictions that people have made based on various models that they put together based on what the deep space radiation environment would be , " he said 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 solar energetic particle events only contributed about 5 % to the overall measured dose equivalent during the laboratory 's cruise to @entity4 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
 but these events are highly variable in terms of frequency and intensity , the study said , and the current cycle seems to be producing a weak solar maximum 	radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @placeholder approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
