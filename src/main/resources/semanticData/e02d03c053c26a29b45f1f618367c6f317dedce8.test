( @entity0 ) -- full disclosure : i have loved watching the @entity3 on television since @entity5 and thoroughly enjoyed being in the cities for the run - up to @entity8 and @entity9 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 costs be damned 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 well , not really 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 but those who moan and groan about the " costs " of the @entity14 movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 @entity18 is a great , safe and hopefully cost effective choice to host the @entity20 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 the @entity22 capital achieved a crushing victory over rivals @entity25 and @entity26 in saturday 's final @entity27 ( @entity27 ) vote 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 as the @entity30 notes , the current budget projections are 0	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
2 % of 2012 gdp 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 plus , more than half of the $ 8 billion build - out cost projections is already set aside , the new hosts tell us 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 architects have already been hard at work 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 full - time and part - time jobs will be created 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 sure , the budget will rise 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 it always does 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 @entity44 tripled its initial budget estimates to $ 14 billion for the construction , security etc	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 and privately raised $ 3 billion or so to stage the games , from corporate sponsors , ticket sales and broadcasting rights 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 construction money came from taxpayers and lottery funding 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020

 it can be done 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 now , @entity3 are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 let 's hope @entity68 's $ 10bn budget ( or more ) is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year - round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a @entity76 grand prix 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 and yes , you can always point to the abysmal state @entity79 was left it with its stadium after 1976 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 it took something like 30 years to pay off 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 @entity79 is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
 it has rightfully scared the @entity27 and host cities into getting it right , or face financial headaches for years to come 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020

 i have not suffered from @entity44 being so busy as july and august just gone 	@entity18 will host the @placeholder for the second time in 2020
