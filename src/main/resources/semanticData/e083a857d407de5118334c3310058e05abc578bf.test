( @entity0 ) -- bagpipes are n't a sound one readily associates with @entity3 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 yet along with the menacingly slow beat of a drum , they 're the soundtrack of one of the country 's more unusual historic tours 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 a small group , illuminated by gas lanterns , is standing at the foot of a medieval moat at the entrance to one of @entity18 's best - preserved medieval cities and a @entity19 -- the @entity20 in @entity21 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 a guide dressed as one of the @entity24 is leading the tour , dredging up some of the island 's more sinister history , including how @entity28 used fallen bodies from his own army to cross the moat during the @entity32 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 experiencing the ' new ' @entity3 perhaps even more surreal than this somewhat kitsch historical re-enactment is the fact that it was conceived by one of the island 's most exclusive resorts : @entity38 ( @entity21 ; +30 22440 35900 ; rooms from $ 213 ; @entity40 $ 203 per person ) 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 this year , the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading " @entity3 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " other excursions include a fishing expedition on a caique ( a traditional wooden fishing boat ) , beauty treatments performed with natural @entity51 products ( yogurt , honey and lemon ) and wine tastings from small vineyards in the surrounding @entity58 islands 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 @entity59 , the hotel 's managing director , says the idea came to her during the six - year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " the whole of @entity3 , it was like a small war , " she tells @entity0 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 while many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all - inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- @entity59 decided to take the opposite approach 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 she launched " @entity3 " to get guests out of the hotel , and to promote sites that , though deserving , had remained under the radar for far too long 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " i wanted to show that there was more to @entity3 than that , and more to @entity3 than feta cheese , " she says 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " the crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking , and to get creative 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 before , we could be a bit arrogant 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 now , we have to be the best 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " nothing to lose @entity59 is n't alone 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 throughout @entity3 , the recession is changing tourist offerings , giving them a new slant 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " the crisis is the best thing that happened to me , " says @entity92 , founder of @entity93 ( +30 6948 405 242 ; tours from $ 60 per person ) 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 @entity92 worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 two years later , she launched her own tourism company 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 like @entity59 , she noticed that tour offerings in @entity102 had been stuck in a rut 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " i looked around at what existed in @entity102 in terms of tourism and it was all very standard , very stereotypical , all ' ancient @entity102 ' , " she says 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " there is so much more to @entity102 than just the ancient part 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " it 's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 so that was the concept 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " in addition to its quirky walking tours ( among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the " enchanted forests " outside the city ) , the company pairs visitors with @entity102 gourmets , who host four - course supper clubs in their apartments 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 she now hosts two tours a day , attracting up to 25 visitors at a time 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 if it were n't for @entity3 's economic slump , she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " it was the kick in the butt i needed 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 i could either go back to the corporate world , which does n't have a future in @entity3 any more , or i could do this 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " so i just jumped in and did it , because there was nothing i could lose 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " beyond the package vacation there are many regions in @entity3 that package tour operators miss , regions that are only recently starting to find their voice 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 the island of @entity151 is a case in point 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 sure , it 's home to @entity155 , a bronze - aged settlement that lays claim to being one of @entity18 's oldest cities 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 it also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist 's heart aflutter and is where the @entity165 was uncovered 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators , low - cost airlines and visitors alike 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " we 're not that kind of destination 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 we have small family - run hotels that focus on service and quality rather than volume , " says @entity173 , who runs boutique travel agency @entity174 to @entity151 ( +30 22870 41008 ; packages from $ 40 per person per day ) 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " we do n't have hotels where you can go in and sell , sell , sell 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " that 's why tour operators do n't like us that much 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 we 're a headache 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry

 you 're leaving a very good , well - paying job for something like this 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 ' " @entity173 recognized that @entity151 had a lot to offer travelers : ancient thermal baths , underwater caves , an old pirate lair , third - century catacombs decorated with @entity202 murals 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 he also recognized that no one was talking up the island 's assets , or making them accessible 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " it 's easy to go online and get a cheap room 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 it 's not easy to get in - depth knowledge of a destination 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " if someone contacts us , we can tell them where to go , or which way the wind is blowing that day 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 " @entity173 supplies more than weather updates 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
 his specialty is archeology and geological tours , which highlight some of the island 's incredible scenery 	@placeholder financial crisis has inspired innovation in country 's tourism industry
