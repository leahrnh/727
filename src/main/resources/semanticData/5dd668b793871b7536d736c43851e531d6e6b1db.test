@entity2 ( @entity1 ) chief justice @entity0 is back in the spotlight 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity0 -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold @entity6 -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the @entity10 @entity9 will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the question at the core of @entity18 v	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity19 is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same - sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by @entity0 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 appointed to the bench by president @entity32 , @entity0 has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same - sex marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 he dissented in @entity10 v	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity37 , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the @entity42 , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same - sex couples 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same - sex marriage bans 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 yet both sides see the case as a legacy - making moment for the 60 - year - old chief justice , and advocates for same - sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " if the @entity37 majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the @entity0 court , " said @entity60 of the @entity61 , which is advocating for same - sex marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity70 want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same - sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice @entity82 , who was nominated to the bench by @entity84 and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when justice @entity87 , a @entity88 appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 or when @entity0 infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold @entity6 on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the hope in conservative circles is that @entity0 will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same - sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " the chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the @entity112 , " said @entity107 , president of the @entity108 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity113 about the ' wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the @entity37 case 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 in his majority opinion , @entity87 said the " principal purpose " of the @entity42 was to " impose inequality 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity0 disagreed 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 he wrote separately to say he thought @entity126 acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide " uniformity and stability " at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity0 picked up on @entity87 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday " come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity147 of the @entity149 @entity148 said that @entity0 could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the @entity18 case 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity0 is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same - sex couples from marriage , " @entity147 said 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 indeed , the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 in the @entity18 case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 another clue to @entity0 ' thinking in the @entity37 dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the @entity42 was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the @entity179 and the @entity180 as well as president @entity181 , who signed it into law 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , " @entity0 wrote 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the @entity18 case that rested on the idea that same - sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 but backers of same - sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity198 points out that @entity0 did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by justices @entity201 , @entity203 and @entity204 , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same - sex marriage do n't violate the @entity112 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " @entity0 did n't join them in expressing those views , " @entity198 said 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 at the time , @entity0 simply wrote that the court " does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide " whether states can ban same - sex marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity198 said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that was n't before the court 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " but i think one reasonable explanation is that @entity0 was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality , " she said 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the @entity42 decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- @entity229 -- that could have determined whether states could ban same - sex marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the case concerned a challenge to @entity235 's @entity234 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same - sex couples from marriage 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 but @entity0 , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated @entity234 and thus paved the way for same - sex marriage in @entity235 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 @entity0 ' lesbian cousin , who lives in @entity235 , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the @entity234 case 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the @entity9 , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing @entity37 -- struck down the state bans 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 on the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 but conventional wisdom was completely wrong 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 without comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same - sex marriages 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 the court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 but some speculate on one possible scenario : @entity0 chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in @entity37 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 then again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about @entity0 ' thinking 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 there 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 and even when @entity0 ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same - sex marriage to proceed in @entity235 -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " when the institution of marriage developed historically , people did n't get around and say , ' let 's have this institution , but let 's keep out homosexuals , ' " @entity0 said during the @entity234 oral arguments 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 " the institution developed to serve purposes that , by their nature , did n't include homosexual couples 	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
 "	chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold @placeholder
