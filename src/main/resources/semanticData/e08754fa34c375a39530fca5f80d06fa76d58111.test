( @entity0 ) -- i first saw the headline early tuesday on @entity3 , a political news site where i generally start my morning 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 it 's not where i expect to see a story on breast cancer 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 then i checked my e-mail messages -- they all seemed to be about @entity9 's op - ed	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 students in my undergraduate class wanted to discuss it in our next session 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 colleagues expressed concern and wondered what the right response was 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 people i do n't even know sent e-mails 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 one , from a research fellow at the @entity21 , nicely summed up the general concern : " i fear that this disclosure will motivate other women to undergo preventive mastectomy , even though they do not need it 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 " wow 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 maybe i should read it 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 i did 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 i found it to be a moving story and understood her choice 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 what i could n't understand initially was the concern expressed by others 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 as the day wore on , the story dominated the news 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 i did n't fully appreciate how much ms	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 @entity9 is admired and respected and had neglected to consider just how powerful a celebrity personal anecdote could be 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 if @entity39 women saw themselves in @entity9 -- then that would be a problem 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 because the logical next question is : should i get a preventive mastectomy 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 then i realized something was missing in her piece ; something that should have been printed in big black letters : note : this story is not relevant to more than 99 % of @entity39 women 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 why 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 because more than 99 % of women do not have the @entity52 mutation -- or the @entity54 mutation , for that matter 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 let 's be clear , the @entity52 mutation is a bad thing 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 although i might quibble with the exact numbers in the piece , the big picture is this : the mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer about five fold and increases the risk of ovarian cancer more than 10 fold 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 it is a powerful risk factor for these cancers -- almost as powerful as cigarette smoking is for lung cancer 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 when people are at very high risk for something bad to happen , preventive interventions are more likely to be a good deal ; that is , the benefits are likely to exceed the harms 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 i 'm not saying that prophylactic mastectomy is the right choice for a woman with @entity52 , simply that it is a reasonable one 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 when people are at average risk , the deal changes 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 the opportunity for benefit is less , simply because the bad event is less likely to happen 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 but the harms of preventive intervention remain roughly the same 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 it is a fundamental precept of medicine -- one i hammer home with undergraduates ( future patients ) and medical students ( future doctors ) : patients with severe abnormalities stand to gain more from intervention than patients with mild ones 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 patients with mild abnormalities are more likely to experience net harm from intervention , simply because they have less opportunity to benefit 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 the vast majority of women do n't have the @entity52 mutation 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 they are at average risk for breast cancer 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 they are not @entity9 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 they should not have a preventive mastectomy 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 a few weeks ago , in a @entity119 piece , @entity117 related her first instinct when facing breast cancer recurrence : take the other breast too 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 her oncologist responded with a simple question : " would an average woman cut off her breasts 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 " i hope not 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 but there is a second question for women raised by ms	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 @entity9 's piece : should i be tested for @entity52 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 she seems to believe the answer is yes , pointing to the half - million women who die from breast cancer worldwide each year 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 but she neglects to point out that 90 % of these deaths have nothing to do with the @entity52 mutation 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 that 's because most women do n't have the mutation and because most breast cancer is sporadic 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 opinion : @entity9 's choice : risks and benefits the few women who are likely to have the mutation are also likely to know they may have it based on the oldest genetic test of all : a strong family history of cancer 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 population - wide screening raises complex issues 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 we would want to know more about how often the test is wrong , particularly how often the test is falsely positive 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 that 's important because women falsely diagnosed as a mutation carrier might undergo prophylactic mastectomy unnecessarily 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 then there are the psychological effects , not only for the patient but also for her siblings and offspring 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 we 'd also need to know more about what a @entity52 mutation means in the absence of family history 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 ms	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 @entity9 's mother died of ovarian cancer at age 56 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 i 'm no geneticist , but i can guess that puts her at higher risk -- both for having the mutation and for developing a bad cancer 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 and we 'd certainly want an answer to the question : must the test cost so much 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 there 's no one right choice for a woman in @entity9 's position , but she may well have made the right choice for her 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 luckily it is a choice most women do n't have to face 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 	@placeholder fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
