 it warned of a spate of incidents of travelers encountering bogus software update pop - ups when they used hotel internet connections overseas 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 when they clicked on the " update , " malicious software was installed on their computer 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 @entity33 connections are particularly risky , said @entity34 , @entity35 security strategist at @entity36 , because they are often set up without proper security settings 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 but they are merely one data - security threat among many facing business travelers 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 from a data - security standpoint , travel is inherently risky , and the likelihood of private personal or corporate data being compromised is greatly increased the moment you hit the road , she said 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 " one of the major ways data loss happens is when people are traveling , " she said 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33

 " anyone can connect to them , which means anyone can look at the traffic going across them , " she said 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 " it 's very easy to sit on one of these things and pick up the traffic going through them 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 there are devices out there that let you hijack them 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 " @entity89 , @entity91 's director of global consumer marketing , said there was a growing trend of hackers setting up mock @entity33 hotspots in public places , which appear at the top of the list of available @entity33 connections 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 " people will see ' free @entity6 ' and click on it , and when they do that they open themselves up to great exposure , " he said 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33

 travelers can also better protect themselves by using encrypted protocols -- simply typing " https : " instead of " http : " at the beginning of @entity132 -- although " https : " is not supported by all websites 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 and they should avoid transmitting sensitive information , such as work documents or credit card details , over public @entity33 spots 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
 " i would be cautious of doing anything sensitive on them , " @entity60 said 	@placeholder has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
