 it was not the girl 's intention to blaspheme against the @entity6 , as she is mentally challenged and could not have understood the content of the pages 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran
 as a minor , the girl can not legally incur punishment 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran

 in @entity1 theology , the @entity6 is not a book but rather , as the name means in @entity114 , the recitation of @entity7 's word 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran
 @entity28 use the printed copies as a memory aid in reciting this word , a word which can never be defiled 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran
 and lastly , to prevent this kind of incident from repeating in the future , we must turn to the help of the state 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran

 within @entity1 history , the @entity28 community has been known for such qualities 	a young @placeholder girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran
