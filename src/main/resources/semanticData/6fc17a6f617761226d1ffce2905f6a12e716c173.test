( @entity1 ) when photographer @entity2 became a father for the first time , he took more than a passing wonder about how his native @entity6 is said to be the most generous nation on @entity9 for parental leave 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 he immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over , you might say 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 he used his photography to document the real - life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of @entity6 's extraordinary program , which allows mothers and fathers to take long , long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 get this : @entity6 grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave , with 390 of them paid at 80 % of income , with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $ 3,474 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 the remaining 90 days are paid at a flat - rate benefit of 20 euros a day , or $ 22 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 but there 's a catch 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 fathers have to share that leave with mothers 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 so to promote both parents to raise their children , @entity6 has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be " daddy months " or " partner months 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 " if the 60 daddy days are n't used , they are lost , reducing the maximum leave to 420 days 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 the country also created a " gender equality bonus " : the more days that parents share the leave equally , they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros , or $ 1,649 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 the idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 in reality , only 12 % of @entity6 couples equally share the 480 days of leave , @entity2 said , with women continuing to lead the way as the stay - at - home parent and men as the careerist 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
 still , @entity2 mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave 	@entity2 photographed fathers in @placeholder , which has generous parental leave
