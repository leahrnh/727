 that was the scene in @entity20 last weekend 	@placeholder high school football teams are helping @entity4 relief efforts
 more than a dozen members of the town 's undefeated high school team went door to door helping their neighbors 	@placeholder high school football teams are helping @entity4 relief efforts
