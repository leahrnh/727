( @entity0 ) -- last month , the @entity1 published an article in its sunday @entity4 section with the headline " sex on campus : she can play that game , too 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 " it focused on what it called the casual hookup culture at my school , the @entity15 , where i am a junior 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 it found that many students see relationships from a purely economic standpoint , subjecting partners to a cost - benefit analysis that ultimately puts sex above romance 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the piece sparked a furious response from students and alumni over its depiction of @entity15 women , including articles in @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34 , our student paper 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 they criticized the article 's sweeping generalizations about young women 's sexuality and its @entity43 Â© conclusions about the men on campus 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 a section inaptly titled " the default is yes " claims that , when alcohol is involved , guys cross the line 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the author , @entity51 , describes an environment in which men take advantage of young , drunk women and then brag about it to their friends , suggesting that this behavior is the norm in an alcohol - driven " frat " culture 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 but not one male student was quoted in the article 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 i understand that men were not the focus of the piece , but when an article header is titled " the default is yes , " the men of @entity15 must stand up for themselves 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 opinion : young adults and a hookup culture here 's the reality : not only does @entity15 have more than 30 fraternities representing a multitude of interests , but the members of these groups span the full range of ethnic , racial and sexual spectrums 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 furthermore , as a collective student body , we take consent very seriously 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 groups like one in four , an all - male peer - education group that , according to its @entity90 page , " focuses on sexual assault awareness and rape prevention , " includes students from both @entity93 and @entity94 organizations 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 this past year , @entity15 hosted a @entity95 to initiate a dialogue on campus about sexuality 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 @entity99 , an international movement and rally opposing violence against women and sexual assault , was the centerpiece of the event 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the incidents presented in the article -- a guy " scoring " while his partner is unconscious and a young woman forced into oral sex -- are undeniably awful 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 if 10 to 16 forcible sex offenses were reported annually between 2009 and 2011 , then we know there must have been many others that went unreported 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 these numbers were enough to spur the formation of a faculty - led commission to address alcohol and drug related sexual violence , but it is an issue that goes beyond policy changes 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the students at @entity15 , not just this commission , are well aware that there is a problem , but it is a problem that we are committed to solving 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 there are men who speak out against violence ; there are men who want monogamous relationships ; there are men in fraternities who walk girls back to their dorms and make sure that they are ok , never even thinking of taking advantage of the situation 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the default answer is not yes , because there is a host of college students who admire the women with whom they go to school and refuse to blame sexual violence on alcohol 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 these women are future world leaders and innovators who might not feel like they have time for a relationship at this stage of their lives , and we respect them even more for making that decision 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 	@entity164 . an article depicted @placeholder culture of female students casually " hooking up "
