( @entity0 ) -- with austerity measures exposing sharp ideological rifts between @entity5 nations , and a shadow now hanging over the future of the single currency , it 's safe to say that relations on the continent have seen better days 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 with this in mind , a new force has emerged to resuscitate the old ideal of a truly unified @entity5 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 but it 's no political party , lobby group or think tank 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 the latest vehicle flying the flag for @entity21 solidarity ( quite literally in this case ) is a 30 meter - long , 44 meter - high yacht 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 according to its founders , the " @entity31 " aims to promote pan-european cooperation and a sense of common identity through the unifying power of sport 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " this boat represents the best of @entity5 in terms of sailing , and it shows that people from different countries can set their differences aside to compete and win as a team 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 when you are not working together you ca n't win , and without winning there is no future , " said the project 's @entity41 co-founder @entity40 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " @entity50 " is the only yacht in the world that has been granted the right to fly the blue and gold @entity5 flag 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 it has also won the backing of two of @entity5 's most powerful men -- the president of the @entity55 , @entity56 , and the president of the @entity58 , @entity57 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 effusive in his support of the yacht , @entity59 recently spoke about the importance of such projects : " a yacht , navigated by a truly @entity5 crew , sailing under the @entity5 flag , is a strong symbol of @entity5 unity and cooperation 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 @entity5 needs such symbols , which have power to unite and inspire , " he said last month in a specially recorded video message , laden with suitably apt sailing metaphors : " today , more than ever , @entity5 are all in the same boat and only together we can ride out of current storm and reach safe harbor 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 the " @entity50 " project is a bright example of the optimism that better times are ahead , " he said 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 if only @entity5 's economic prospects really were aligned with the fortune 's of the " @entity85 " 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 its highly experienced 18 - man pan-european crew , led by two - time @entity89 winner and three - time @entity92 @entity91 champion @entity88 , has so far claimed 11 consecutive wins -- breaking two course records in their 2010 rookie season alone 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 more from @entity96 : @entity97 says she 's relieved to be back on land but working with so many nationalities on one boat ( the crew is composed of representatives from six @entity21 countries ) poses evident communication problems 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " to become successful we had to agree on a common language , " says skipper @entity88 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " we chose @entity108 for obvious reasons , but as people do n't have that many words in their personal @entity108 dictionary we 've ended up with a very efficient and ' to - the - point ' language , which works in our favor during races 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " @entity88 , who grew up in @entity116 , believes his experiences -- both before and after the fall of the @entity119 -- has made him appreciate the vision of a united @entity5 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " i am proud to be @entity92 , but i am also proud to be @entity5 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 being the skipper of this boat is very much like my personal vision for @entity5 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 of course there are always going to be some @entity5 that feel more nationalistic than others -- even in a team like ours -- but as long as we share the same goal and work together we can win , " he said 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 however , at the moment there are few instances of teams competing under the @entity5 flag , with the rare notable exception of the @entity137 - the biennial golf competition between @entity5 and @entity139 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 according to the @entity144 's professor @entity143 , who has written extensively on the connections between sports and politics , the reason there are so few pan-european sports teams reflects the problem of individual emotional engagement 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " in sports where the emotional stakes are very high , such as football or ice hockey , it 's unlikely that these ( continental ) types of teams will appear because people care too much about their clubs and national teams , " he said 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " in sports where the emotional stakes are low it could work -- but then it will just remain cute and nice , simply because it does n't matter to people 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 it 's always easy to unite in intellect but not as easy in terms of your guts , " he added 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 the greater issue , @entity143 argues , is that sport is by its very nature combative 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " in sports you will always have a winner and a loser 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 it 's a zero - sum game 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 so you have to ask yourself whom is a pan-national team competing against 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " watch related : the secret world of the @entity89 as things stand , the " @entity182 " is only scheduled to compete against boats represented in the big @entity5 regattas 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 but if its visionary founder @entity40 has anything to do with it , there will soon be a new breed of regatta 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " i think in the future you might see continents or regions race against each other , such as @entity5 against the @entity139 and @entity194 , " he said 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 but with national @entity197 sentiment spreading , and the @entity198 on the brink of a possible collapse , can a yacht really be the a symbol which unifies a continent 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 @entity88 , at least , believes it can 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " for centuries sailing has been a way of connecting countries and continents , " he said 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 " so i think ' @entity85 ' is a very fitting symbol of what we are trying to achieve -- which is to show the world that we are always stronger if we work together 	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
 "	skipper @placeholder is a three time @entity92 @entity91 champion and two times @entity89 winner
