@entity0 ( @entity1 ) @entity2 is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the @entity5 , kicking her legs up to her head , jumping and spinning across the room 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 after class , she eats boiled sweets , one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the dancer , raised in @entity15 and @entity16 , left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in @entity20 six years ago , aged 15 , speaking no @entity20 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 she studied at the @entity21 and was one of the first @entity23 accepted from the school into the company 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 but in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed @entity29 official to pay $ 10,000 to dance in even small roles 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the @entity21 still stands by comments made at the time by its general director , @entity33 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 he asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally , saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that " if the facts are legally established , those responsible should be punished accordingly 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " the dancer did not pursue a case against the @entity45 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 when she left the @entity21 in 2013 , @entity2 joined the @entity5 where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the @entity20 president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the @entity5 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not : for her role as a principal dancer @entity2 says she is paid around $ 240 a month -- which works out at around $ 8 a day 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the @entity20 ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on @entity20 over its annexation of @entity64 last year 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 @entity2 says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " for anyone paid a salary in rubles , especially since the crisis , it is extremely difficult 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 you have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 i 'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " sitting in the wings of the stage , chatting in @entity20 to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for @entity88 , she says she has to make the $ 185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 to earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the @entity5 says @entity2 's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that , " on average , the salary [ principal ] dancers are paid is significantly higher " than $ 240 a month but that @entity2 could have been paid that equivalent in dollars " depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " as an @entity23 , @entity2 says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the @entity20 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 but she says that is not always the case offstage 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " it 's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the @entity23 and @entity20 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 the great thing about working for a @entity20 company is that we are focused on creating art but 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners ; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " although relations between the @entity23 and @entity20 have taken a nosedive since @entity20 's annexation of @entity64 last march , @entity2 says she is " very loyal " to the @entity5 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 " i love the @entity20 system and i 'm very patriotic in that sense , " she says 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
 and despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says , " @entity20 has a lot to offer , it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one 's career in 	@entity2 studied at @placeholder but left in cloud of controversy
