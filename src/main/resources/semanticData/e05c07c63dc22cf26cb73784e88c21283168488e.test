if beauty is indeed truth , as @entity3 claimed , then this story ought to be true : the logo on the back of your @entity6 or @entity8 is a tribute to @entity10 , the man who laid the foundations for the modern - day computer , pioneered research into artificial intelligence and unlocked @entity16 wartime codes 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 his death , a decade after the end of the war , provides the link with @entity21 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 unrecognized for his work , facing jail for gross indecency and humiliated by estrogen injections intended to ' cure ' his homosexuality , he bit into an apple he had laced with cyanide 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 he died in obscurity on june 7 , 1954 , 10 years and a day after the @entity33 , which made copious use of intelligence gleaned by his methods 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 and so , the story goes , when two @entity41 entrepreneurs were looking for a logo for their brand new computer company , they remembered @entity10 and his contribution to their field 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 they chose an apple -- not a complete apple , but one with a bite taken out of it 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 sadly , the truth is rarely as simple , or beautiful , as we would like 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 i first researched this story in 2005 and was assured by someone at @entity21 that it was indeed true 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 the article struck a chord and several people got in touch to say how pleased or touched they were to hear the story 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 a few years later i mentioned it to another @entity21 employee , who immediately said that he thought it was a myth 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 it may have started around the time of the 2001 film about the @entity69 code breakers , @entity70 , or it may have just resurfaced then 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 he checked with @entity21 headquarters , and although they were non-committal , it was clear that that @entity10 story was not official @entity21 history 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 other theories were advanced 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 the apple represented knowledge , as in the biblical story of @entity81 , or referenced the falling fruit that led sir @entity83 to the concept of gravity 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 supporters of the latter theory note the name of @entity21 's handheld pda , the @entity83 , but that was more than a decade after the creation of the logo 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 sadly , the evidence now points in a more prosaic direction 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 in a 2009 interview with @entity96 , @entity97 , the man who drew the logo , reflected on the theories about his work 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 he dismisses sir @entity83 or the @entity103 as source material and , while he says he is charmed by the links with the @entity10 story , he says he was unaware of them at the time 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 " i 'm afraid it did n't have a thing to do with it , " he said 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 " it 's a wonderful urban legend 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 " @entity97 says that he received no specific brief from @entity113 , and although he 's hazy about how he settled on the simple outline of an apple , the reason for the bite is crystal clear : it 's there for scale , he says , so that a small @entity21 logo still looks like an apple and not a cherry 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 it was n't long before @entity97 discovered the first happy coincidence of his design , when a colleague told him that " bytes " were the foundation stones of computing 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 the more romantic myth - making would follow soon behind 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 i was disappointed when the @entity10 story was first cast into doubt , but grew to enjoy the uncertainty 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 @entity136 seemed a fitting , even poetic state , for the tale of a man who lived in the shadows 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association

 i hope that a similar respect for beauty over cold , hard fact lay behind @entity113 ' silence on the matter 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
 he could have dismissed the creation myths inspired by his company , but he chose not to 	@placeholder logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association
