( @entity4 ) after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the @entity0 now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 on its website , the @entity0 prominently states , " it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " and later , it says that " in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " but the @entity0 is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former @entity24 athletes 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in @entity0 history 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 in its response , the @entity0 says it has no legal responsibility " to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student - athletes at its member institutions 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the @entity0 has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , @entity0 attorneys wrote in this court filing that " the @entity0 did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student - athletes , " and " the @entity0 does not have ' direct , day - to - day , operational control ' " over member institutions like @entity24 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " it 's nonsense 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 it 's double talk , " said @entity51 , a former athletic - academic director who is now president of @entity52 for academic integrity in collegiate sport 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " if you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , " @entity51 said 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " the @entity0 referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : the @entity0 believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the @entity0 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the @entity0 has taken to assist student - athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the @entity0 to ensure that every student - athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , " said @entity83 , @entity0 chief legal officer 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the @entity97 or @entity98 , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 the scandal at @entity24 involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 @entity111 , the @entity24 whistleblower turned @entity0 critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 the system of eligibility that the @entity0 brags about , she says , is a sham 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 it makes no sense , " said @entity111 , who recently wrote a book about the @entity24 scandal called " cheated 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " " if they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 it 's lost its meaning for me 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " the @entity0 's claim that it 's hands - off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , @entity145 , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 for example , before it lost a case filed by former @entity151 player @entity150 , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the @entity0 stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 that 's the defense the @entity0 is now using in another class action filed by big - time sports attorney @entity164 , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 in response , the @entity0 said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with " its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with @entity0 bylaws 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " attorney @entity185 , who represented both @entity150 and now the @entity24 athletes , said this : " this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the @entity0 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 @entity0 president @entity145 has repeatedly proposed that ' what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the @entity0 's record tells a far different story 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " but @entity198 , professor of sport management at @entity200 , said it 's not realistic to think that the @entity0 would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " i understand , i think , where the @entity0 is coming from 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 we would not let the @entity0 come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at @entity200 , " he said 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " it sounds like someone is trying to say the @entity0 should have been supervising that department at the @entity24 , and there 's no logic to that , " he said 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " the people who are saying the @entity0 should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the @entity0 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " @entity24 , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the " educational malpractice " theory does n't apply 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 @entity24 claims it is protected by state law 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 this is reminiscent of another @entity0 reversal 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 the @entity0 , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from " dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , " now says it does not enforce health and safety rules 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the @entity0 wrote : " the @entity0 denies that it has a legal duty to protect student - athletes 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " a @entity4 investigation found that the @entity0 has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the @entity244 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 @entity245 , president of the @entity246 , and a leading thorn in the @entity0 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the @entity0 leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 " there 's nothing left the @entity0 can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 one has to wonder what does the @entity0 do if it does n't protect players 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 if it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 it begs the question of why does the @entity0 exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption 	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
 "	lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at @placeholder
