( @entity1 ) the sun had n't risen at @entity2 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 most students slept in their beds 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 a few had woken up to head to early morning @entity7 prayers 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 then the terror began 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 it started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
m	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 thursday ( 10:30 p	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
m	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 et wednesday ) at the @entity14 school 's front gates 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 the attackers continued to fire as they stalked through campus , with the @entity17 saying they stopped at a girls ' dormitory 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 at one point , they burst into a room where @entity21 had gathered and took hostages , said lecturer @entity23 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 a student in the room told @entity26 , a reporter with @entity1 affiliate @entity27 , that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately , striking his thigh 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " then they proceeded to the hostels , " @entity23 told @entity1 , referring to the university dorm , " shooting anybody they came across -- except their fellows , the @entity35 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " according to @entity38 , the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed @entity35 to leave 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 this would be consistent with the past practices of @entity43 , the @entity44 - based terror group that 's claimed responsibility for the attack 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 that 's what @entity43 did in a december raid on a quarry in the @entity14 village of @entity52 , near the @entity44 border , that ended with at least 36 killed 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 whatever their religion , hundreds of students managed to escape , said @entity56 , a reporter with @entity1 affiliate @entity57 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 some ran 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 some crawled 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 all feared for their lives 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 and they were the lucky ones 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 it was n't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around @entity66 finally ended 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 interior ministry secretary @entity67 announced that four terrorists were killed and the operation had ended " successfully 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " by then , 147 people were dead and plans were " underway to evacuate students and other affected persons , " the @entity70 tweeted 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " it is a very sad day for @entity14 , " @entity67 said 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 some of those students , at one point or another , were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 yet others like @entity23 managed to find safety , in his case at the staff residence 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 others escaped the college 's grounds 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 @entity56 , for instance , told @entity1 that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid- 90 - degree heat thursday in a corner of a @entity66 airstrip , surrounded by military officials 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 one student , @entity95 , recalled to @entity38 how " everyone started running " after hearing blasts and gunshots 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " there were those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing , " @entity95 said 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " i am lucky to be alive , because i jumped through the fence with other students 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " @entity105 fled into a nearby field with " bullets following us 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " she escaped unscathed , but a few of her friends did not 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " we saw some bloodstains , " @entity105 told @entity38 , " and they were shot 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " such terrorism , sadly , is n't new to the people of eastern @entity14 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 and that 's largely thanks to @entity43 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 while it is based in @entity44 , the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring @entity14 -- most notoriously a 2013 siege of @entity121 's upscale @entity120 that left at least 67 dead 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 a primary aim of such attacks is thought to be sowing terror 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 there 's also a religious undercurrent , given @entity43 's once and possibly future goal of creating a fundamentalist @entity129 state , according to the @entity130 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 needless to say , that aim is n't shared in most places -- particularly in @entity14 , where more than 80 % of citizens are @entity7 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 such violence is more likely in towns like @entity66 , given its location 90 miles west of the @entity44 border 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 what makes thursday 's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning , presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the @entity14 and allied governments ' fight against @entity43 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 such an attack is more reminiscent of what other @entity153 extremist groups , the @entity149 @entity148 and @entity150 , did in respectively attacking a school in @entity156 , @entity149 , and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in @entity159 , @entity160 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 @entity2 began in the 1990s as @entity161 before evolving , by government decree , into its current form as a degree - granting institution in 2011 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 as of this spring , the school had schools of education , information science , and arts and social sciences 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 and it was growing , with its staff of 75 set to expand to 200 by year 's end , according to the college 's website 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 it 's too early to tell what the future now holds for @entity2 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 but @entity14 president @entity180 on thursday urged people around the @entity183 nation " to stay calm as we resolve this matter 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " " this is a moment , " @entity180 said , " for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
 " @entity1 's @entity189 contributed to this report 	@placeholder students wake to explosions and gunfire
