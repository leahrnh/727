@entity3 , @entity4 ( @entity5 ) traveling to @entity4 these days , the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words : confident and optimistic 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 after a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between @entity4 and world powers , many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted , and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " naturally we are all very happy , " one woman in central @entity3 told us 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " we expect better days economically and culturally 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 we want better relations with the rest of the world 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " another man added , " i have a good feeling about it , because my country will be free of the fear of war 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " but this weekend , just a few miles down the road , @entity4 's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual @entity37 parade 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 as the @entity39 , @entity40 and other countries criticize @entity4 for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the @entity45 rebels who have seized power in much of @entity47 , @entity4 president @entity38 has praised the military as peacemakers for the @entity50 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " today , our army is the source of our national stability , " @entity38 said in his speech at the parade 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " and even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " the country 's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with western media outlets 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 major general @entity65 , the chief of staff of @entity4 's armed forces and a man who is close to @entity38 , told @entity5 he hopes the @entity39 and @entity4 can work closer together to fight @entity69 in @entity70 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " the unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live , and their right to freedom , dictates that all human society is threatened by @entity69 , and all humans should unite against @entity69 and work against them , " @entity65 said 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 @entity81 also repeated @entity4 's longstanding claim that the @entity39 is partly responsible for creating @entity69 , which now controls large parts of @entity70 and @entity84 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " if the @entity39 really did n't create @entity69 , and if they want to destroy @entity69 , it is possible for them to achieve that , " he said 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " but we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the @entity39 and @entity90 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 we hope that one day , because of their national interests and the will of their nations , the @entity39 and the @entity90 will decide to really fight @entity69 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " @entity4 has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective , while praising its own strategy of training , advising , outfitting and directing @entity99 militias , @entity101 forces and the @entity70 military 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 but in another apparent softening of rhetoric , a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between @entity4 and @entity39 will fade 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " at the moment , we consider the @entity39 to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us , " general @entity107 , the commander of @entity4 's ground forces , told @entity5 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " we would like the @entity39 to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the @entity39 military leadership , " @entity107 continued 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " we trust the @entity39 people , but the tone of @entity39 government and military officials is such that we still consider the @entity39 a threat 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " at the same time , @entity4 's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual " death to @entity129 , death to the @entity39 " chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 the @entity39 welcomes some of @entity4 's support for @entity70 forces in the fight against @entity69 , but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 and for @entity4 's part , @entity142 ayatollah @entity141 has also rejected direct coordination between the two long - time adversaries 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 and even though many @entity4 have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal , the leadership in @entity147 and @entity3 is far more skeptical 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 in a recent televised speech , @entity141 said it was possible that there would be no deal by the june 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 and @entity4 's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 meanwhile , the @entity161 has been confronted by a @entity162 that is largely hostile to the negotiations , and has been making the case that a deal can not be about trust , but about monitoring and verification 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " our main concern here is making sure that if @entity4 does n't abide by its agreement , that we do n't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions , " @entity39 president @entity171 said last friday 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " that 's our main concern 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 and i think that goal , of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation , that goal can be met 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 " so far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
 but despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air , there is also fear that things could fall apart if @entity3 and @entity147 are n't willing to make tough concessions 	@placeholder has welcomed limited @entity4 help in fight against @entity69 but neither side plans full coordination
