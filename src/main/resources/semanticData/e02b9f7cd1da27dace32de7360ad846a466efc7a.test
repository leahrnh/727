( @entity0 ) -- if you go down to the " @entity2 " today , you 're sure of a big surprise -- and if anyone tries to spoil it , my advice would be to shut them up quick 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 believe me , you do n't want to know 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 but this is a movie people are going to need to talk about , so if you 're at all invested in horror movies -- what they are , what they 're for , what they can be -- you best see this one quick , and steer clear of @entity16 until you have 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 what can i tell you without saying too much 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 for starters , you have to know that this is the first feature directed by @entity20 , a writer from the " @entity21 , " " @entity22 , " " lost " school , based on a screenplay he co-wrote with the considerably famous " @entity21 " , " @entity25 " , " @entity22 " creator @entity26 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 fans of those shows wo n't be disappointed by these horror hipsters ' acidic , postmodern designs on one of the movie industry 's hoariest , least respected staples 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 @entity26 also wrote " @entity34 " of course -- which may be why the wild , nutso finale seems to owe a debt to another @entity39 movie 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 but let 's not go there 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 the outline is as crude as the title suggests : @entity44 has been telling us to be afraid of the backwoods at least since " @entity47 , " and " deliverance " ( before that , it was the old dark manse on the hill ) 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 by now the homespun log cabin is more likely to evoke the evil undead than @entity54 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 but just as the clever poster image puts its own twist on the familiar picture , transforming the house into a kind of spinning @entity60 , @entity20 's movie quickly puts its own distinctive kink on horror @entity63 Â© s	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 by quickly , i mean from the very first scene , which wittily undercuts the portentous opening music and sets up the movie 's first puzzle : how do the casually smug , cynical lab - coated technicians played by @entity71 and @entity72 relate to the five bright , sexy college kids we see taking off for a cousin 's countryside retreat 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 you could probably figure it out : there are only so many permutations available after all 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 but then again , you would probably be wrong 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 " @entity84 " does n't just keep us on our toes , it chops them off at the knee with a rusty scythe 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 how spoiler culture ( mostly ) spared ' @entity84 ' @entity20 winks at horror 's soiled conventions , but does n't denigrate his characters by resorting to camp ( well , except perhaps in the scary fundamentalist redneck the kids encounter when they try to buy gas ) 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 one of the questions he wants to explore is how much free will we want to see in a human sacrifice 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 or put it another way : if you give a puppet enough rope , will he hang himself 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 thus , @entity107 's sympathetic @entity106 -- not quite a virgin , but clearly the designated " good girl " -- is something more than just the sum of her body parts ( even if she is upstaged by a dismembered arm in one scene ) , and @entity115 's witty pot - head conspiracy theorist is such an engaging personality the movie risks deflating without him 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 yes , they 're archetypes , but they 're not stereotypes -- the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you 'd expect 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 maybe -- if we 're being picky -- this is all too self - consciously clever to be truly scary on the visceral , soul - gnawing level of the most unforgettable horror films 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 but there 's no question that this is one of the most entertaining and invigorating shockers in recent years 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
 it 's also one of the best movies of 2012 so far , in any genre 	" @placeholder ' " is directed by @entity20 and co-written by @entity26
