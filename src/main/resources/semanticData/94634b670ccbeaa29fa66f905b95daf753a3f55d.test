 and this " @entity27 " is harmful to @entity5 's international image , riles @entity24 and @entity25 and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 @entity28 deliberately set the bar on history very low for @entity0 because the @entity32 administration is more focused on the shared perception with @entity7 that contemporary @entity24 is a threat requiring a collective response 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 strengthening the alliance with @entity5 and sealing the deal on the @entity38 trumps past misdeeds 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions

 " that is welcome news , but @entity5 has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies , precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but @entity0 is mounting a significant retreat from @entity5 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid- 1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions

 rather than merely " upholding " what others have said it might have been better for @entity0 to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 in @entity5 , there has been a lot of pressure on @entity0 to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 @entity141 that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 even the conservative @entity146 newspaper urged him to do so 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
 @entity147 clearly condemned " mistaken national policy , " " self - righteous nationalism , " " colonial rule " and " aggression , " but @entity0 has spent his entire political career renouncing this so - called " masochistic " view of @entity5 's wartime history 	but he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @placeholder 's wartime actions
