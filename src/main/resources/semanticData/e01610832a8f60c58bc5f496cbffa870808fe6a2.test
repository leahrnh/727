editor 's note : this is an excerpt from @entity5 contributor @entity4 's new book , " @entity6 : a @entity7 , " a memoir of his time working at an @entity12 newspaper in the 1960s 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 the localness of what we did down at the paper defined everything 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 even as a kid brand - new to the staff and brand - new to the newspaper business , hired to work during summer vacations , i could tell that 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 @entity4 recalls a 1967 lesson in manners from @entity28 football coach @entity27 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 it was a localness not confined to the geographic scope of our news coverage -- it went without saying that the @entity34 , @entity12 , @entity33 was n't about to send its reporters to @entity36 or @entity37 ( or even to @entity38 or @entity39 ) 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 the men and women in the city room arrived at work each day knowing that they were n't going to be assigned to anyplace from where they could n't drive back to the office by deadline 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 the localness extended beyond that , though , and infused the very feel of the place 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 one night in the summer of 1967 the phone on the sports desk rang and i picked it up with the customary : " @entity55 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " the person on the other end said : " now , that 's no way to answer a telephone , is it 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " " who 's calling 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " to whom am i speaking 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " this is @entity4 , " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " now , i 've seen your name in the paper , " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " it 's @entity4 , is n't it 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " i had been permitted to write a few sports stories that summer ; i used the " jr	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " at the end of the byline 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " yes , " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 i thought i recognized the voice from somewhere 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " now , i believe i know your mother and father , " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " are your parents @entity81 and @entity82 , from @entity83 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " " yes , " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " i know they did n't raise you to answer a phone that way , " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " when you answer a business telephone , the proper way to do it is to tell the caller your name first 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " " all right , sir , " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " i know your parents are fine people , and i 'm sure they taught you good manners , " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " you do n't want to disappoint them by giving a bad impression of yourself on the telephone , do you 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " " no , sir , " i said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " good , " the caller said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " now , this is @entity27 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 i was calling to speak with @entity101 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 is @entity101 there , please 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " and , my hands shaking , i connected him with @entity104 , one of the paper 's sportswriters 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 i knew it really was the head coach of the @entity28 football team because of that phrase early in his lecture to me -- " to whom am i speaking 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " his grammar was always scrupulous -- no " who am i speaking to 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " from @entity27 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 the localness was all around us 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 @entity27 had met my mother and father on a few occasions , he remembered them , and he was setting their son straight 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 he may have been the most nationally famous person in the community , but he was first and foremost a member of that community -- during all his years as head football coach at @entity28 , @entity27 kept his home telephone number listed in the @entity34 phone book : @entity131 , on @entity132 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 that made for a lot of late - night crank calls from a lot of insulting or drunken people , but he thought that if he was going to represent the community , then he should be as available as any other man or woman in town 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 once , years later , i heard a story -- i 'm almost certain that it was @entity33 sportswriter @entity144 who told it 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 it seemed that very early in @entity148 's golf career , @entity148 's father , @entity150 , a @entity34 pharmacist , was following his son on tour , and @entity27 offered to travel with @entity153 to keep him company and provide moral support 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 apparently at one tournament someone in the gallery kept referring to @entity148 as " @entity159 " -- @entity148 was a little hefty in those younger days 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 and , the way i remember the story , either @entity27 had to physically restrain @entity153 from going after the fan , or @entity153 had to restrain @entity27 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 ( i have a feeling i know which one was which 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 ) it was all part of the localness 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 @entity27 and @entity153 were two @entity34 residents on the road to cheer for a local golfer ; the fact that the local golfer would become the greatest ever to play the game was incidental 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 and we -- in the eyes of our readers , and in our own eyes , too -- were , proudly , the local paper 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 that was all , and everything , we aspired to be 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 just like the proud local papers in a thousand other @entity183 towns 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 " i know they did n't raise you to answer a phone that way , " @entity27 said 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 he thought , by saying it , he was doing me a favor 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
 he was 	@entity4 's new memoir is titled " @placeholder : a @entity7 "
