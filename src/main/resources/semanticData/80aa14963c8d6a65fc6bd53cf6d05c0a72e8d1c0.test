@entity7 ( @entity8 ) a new entry and a waiting game on the @entity3 side , a go - slow approach from a leading @entity5 , and the big stakes of 2016 filled our sunday morning trip around the " @entity12 " table 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165

 @entity14 is about to get her first official challenger 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165

 @entity16 of @entity17 could make an announcement within days , reports @entity8 's @entity19 , adding a populist voice to a @entity3 race that starts with @entity22 as the overwhelming favorite 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 @entity16 has been exploring a run for months , and was a hit this weekend at a big @entity27 @entity3 event 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " i do n't think he can necessarily challenge @entity14 in terms of donors and in terms of organization , " said @entity28 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " but in terms of bringing the heat , bringing the fire , bringing that populist rhetoric , he 'll be interesting to see , and how he moves @entity14 's own rhetoric as well 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165

 for @entity38 , watch , wait and 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 few think vice president @entity38 is willing to risk a third losing bid for the @entity3 presidential nomination 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but his official word is that he is still looking at the race , and @entity43 of the @entity44 reports that this " wait and see " approach is likely to continue for a bit 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " there is a strain of thinking that if @entity14 's campaign is truly to implode at some point , that @entity3 are going to need someone who can jump in quickly , raise a lot of money and have a lot of experience and launch a campaign , " said @entity47 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " and @entity38 would not mind being the person they talk about as that person 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 so , and as long as we are talking about that , we are still talking about @entity38 , and that 's just the way he likes it 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165

 @entity66 also thinks waiting is best @entity68 gov	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 @entity66 is more visible of late , and makes no secret of the fact that he thinks he is the most qualified among the potential @entity5 2016 presidential prospects 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but he is n't in a rush to make a formal declaration of candidacy 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 some see this as hesitation 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but @entity78 of the @entity79 detailed a conversation with the @entity68 governor in which @entity66 made the case that he need not rush 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " he 's not formally moving toward it right now , " said @entity78 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " but i do n't think he feels a rush , because in this age of super pacs , it 's more about building donor relationships , building relationships in the early states , then maybe getting in when you have a little momentum 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " 4 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 listen to the candidates -- and be reminded of the high stakes personalities often trump policy in political coverage , especially in the early days of a campaign 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but the old line " elections have consequences " gets repeated a lot because it just happens to be true 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 @entity104 's @entity103 says the prospect of big changes was obvious as he did some recent homework about the 2016 race 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " @entity109 was asked this past week about president @entity111 executive actions on immigration , and he said on a conservative radio talk show , ' yes , of course i would reverse them , ' " said @entity103 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " so suddenly you are talking about millions of people who are on a path to be legalized for a while , now potentially on a path not to be legalized , depending on who wins an election 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 " " does n't mean they would go through with it 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 i think we all can recall president @entity128 's promise to close @entity129 right away if he could just replace president @entity109 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but it certainly would color the campaign and the tenor of the campaign -- the huge changes that could lie in store depending on who wins 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165

 remember @entity138 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 the @entity5 establishment sure does 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 goal @entity140 for @entity5 in 2016 is taking back the @entity141 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 but preserving their new @entity143 majority runs a close second -- and that will be no easy task , because so many of the competitive races are in states that tend to lean blue in presidential years 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 so the @entity5 establishment is putting a priority on candidate recruitment and hoping to build on its 2014 successes , which you might recall included an aggressive effort to discourage or defeat @entity156 candidates viewed as too risky by the establishment 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 so in @entity159 , where @entity161 @entity160 is retiring , there is an intensifying effort to get @entity5 rep	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 @entity5 to declare his @entity143 candidacy 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 and in @entity165 , the establishment favorite is rep	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 @entity166 , who opened a lot of eyes with his 2014 race in a competitive swing district against a top - tier @entity3 opponent 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 those two states -- and those two seats -- have special significance in the 2016 maneuvering : @entity160 and @entity165 democrat @entity176 won narrow 2010 victories in what was for the most part a big @entity5 year 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
 ask the establishment why , and you will get a ton of finger - pointing at the @entity156 candidates who emerged as the @entity5 nominees -- @entity138 in @entity159 and @entity185 in @entity165 	@entity5 recruiting @placeholder candidates for 2016 in @entity159 and @entity165
