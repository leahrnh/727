 it comes in a yellow - labeled bottle with a fire - breathing demon on it 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 it tastes like @entity16 chewing gum 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 it 's @entity18 , and lately it 's been as hot as its name 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 " @entity18 is number one , definitely 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 that 's pretty much the chosen shot , " said @entity1 , who enjoys it herself now and then 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice

 ( the " whisky " spelling generally refers to @entity73 or @entity68 varieties , while " whiskey " refers to @entity76 or @entity35 styles 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 ) its slogan is " tastes like heaven , burns like hell , " but that 's an exaggeration 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 fireball has a kick , but it does n't burn as much as straight whiskeys , cheap tequilas or even the @entity31 hard candy that helped inspire its name 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 it 's also only 66 proof , or 33 % alcohol -- less than most whiskeys 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice

 @entity124 's @entity123 before its maker , the @entity125 , rebranded it in 2006 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 sales were modest until about five years ago , when @entity125 hired a " national brand ambassador , " @entity129 , to spread the word about @entity18 through event planning and bartender outreach 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 in other words , @entity129 traveled the country serving up fireball shots in bars 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 he started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures , such as @entity140 and @entity141 , and then spread to other places 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 everywhere he went , @entity129 shared his @entity144 exploits on @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 and encouraged patrons to do the same 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 soon , @entity18 started gaining traction 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 then it exploded 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 retail sales jumped from just under $ 2 million in 2011 to $ 63 million in 2013 to $ 130 million last year , according to @entity152 , a @entity153 - based market research firm 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 along the way , @entity125 has cultivated a party - hearty social ethos around @entity18 , encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as # @entity160 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 the brand has more than 85,000 followers on @entity146 and another 43,000 on @entity147 -- more than twice the social reach of @entity46 -- although on @entity146 , it still trails @entity165 's whiskey and patron tequila 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 and it got a boost in october when someone taped a @entity171 camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice

 retail sales remain strong , according to @entity152 , although @entity18 's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 but it 's under siege from several fronts 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 the past year has brought copycats @entity202 and @entity203 , both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup , along with cinnamon vodkas , cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 fireball also endured a public - relations mess last fall when several @entity212 countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients : propylene glycol , a chemical used in a variety of food products , e-cigarettes and antifreeze 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 @entity125 responded that propylene glycol exists in @entity31 " in very small quantities " -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the @entity227 ( @entity228 ) -- and reassured customers that @entity18 is " absolutely safe to drink 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 " then there 's the question of whether @entity18 will become a victim of its own success 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
 young consumers are notoriously fickle , and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it 	the liquor has dethroned @entity46 as @placeholder shot of choice
