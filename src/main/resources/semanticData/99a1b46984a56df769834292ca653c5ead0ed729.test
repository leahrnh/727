( @entity1 ) relations between @entity2 and @entity3 have always been thorny , but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity6 and @entity7 each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the @entity11 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 in its most recent incarnation , the @entity2 - @entity3 conflict by proxy has reached @entity15 in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 for @entity7 and its regional allies , the @entity3 military intervention in @entity15 -- " @entity20 " -- is the moment the @entity23 finally woke up to repel the expansion of @entity26 - @entity2 influence 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 for @entity6 and its regional allies -- including the @entity29 movement in @entity15 -- @entity3 's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the @entity15 crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 when @entity2 president @entity39 was elected in june 2013 , he pledged to reach out to @entity7 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 he was up front and called @entity6 's steep deterioration of relations with the @entity3 over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on @entity2 foreign policy 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 from @entity45 and @entity46 to @entity47 and the @entity48 , the @entity2 - @entity3 rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 and yet despite @entity39 's open pledge , profound differences over @entity53 and @entity54 in particular have kept @entity7 and @entity6 apart 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 but if the questions of @entity53 and @entity54 prevented a pause in hostilities , the @entity3 military intervention in @entity15 since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 unlike in @entity53 and in @entity54 , the @entity3 military is now directly battling it out with @entity2 - backed rebels in @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 while @entity7 no doubt exaggerates @entity6 's role in the @entity15 crisis , its fingerprints are nonetheless evident 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " @entity2 provides financial support , weapons , training and intelligence to @entity29 , " @entity68 , a @entity69 official and former @entity15 ambassador , told a congressional hearing last week 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " we believe that @entity2 sees opportunities with the @entity29 to expand its influence in @entity15 and threaten @entity3 and @entity81 @entity80 interests 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " the @entity2 find the charges biased and point to the @entity3 airstrikes in @entity15 as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor 's affairs 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 in @entity2 , the cue came from the country 's top authority , @entity92 ayatollah @entity91 , who has been unusually blunt 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 he tweeted : " despite disputes , the @entity3 used to display composure [ with ] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [ with ] barbarism 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " three days after @entity91 's speech , @entity2 suspended religious pilgrimages to @entity103 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 this came as news broke about two @entity2 teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting @entity3 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 meanwhile , @entity109 protests have been staged in a number of @entity2 cities 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity91 's speech opened the floodgate of @entity109 statements 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the voices of hardline figures in @entity6 have been the most agitated 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 general @entity116 , the commander of the @entity2 ground forces , taunted the @entity3 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " beware of the day when firecrackers explode in @entity7 , " @entity116 said , in a not - so - subtle warning 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 but it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the @entity3 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity123 - @entity122 , a former president and arguably @entity2 's most vocal advocate of better @entity2 - @entity3 relations 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 called @entity7 's military intervention a " strategic mistake " and urged for a political solution 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 seeking a political solution is @entity2 's stated aim for the @entity15 crisis , but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity2 foreign minister @entity134 has provided a four - point plan : to get a ceasefire , to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid , to promote political dialogue among warring @entity15 parties , and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 but the @entity2 proposal also asks for an end to @entity3 airstrikes 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 as @entity134 put it , " @entity2 and @entity3 need to talk , but we can not talk to determine the future of @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " the @entity3 have thus far ignored the @entity2 proposal 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 meanwhile , the @entity29 leadership has welcomed the plan 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 as one of its leaders said , " in @entity2 's plan , unacceptable solutions do not exist 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 " not only do the @entity3 not have any faith in any @entity2 - drafted political package that is welcomed by the @entity29 , but @entity7 believes that the international disposition favors it 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity3 was elated by the @entity158 vote on 14 april that condemned the @entity29 movement 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 only @entity160 abstained 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 but a solution to the @entity15 crisis will not come from the @entity158 the @entity158 can provide a cover for @entity7 's military intervention , but it can not secure it a military win 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 this leaves @entity7 with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity3 airstrikes alone will not finish off the @entity29 movement and it allies in the @entity15 armed forces 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 it requires ground troops on a huge scale 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity7 has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the @entity47 most famously turned down the @entity3 request and let it be known that @entity15 is a quagmire they can do without 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 instead , @entity185 has asked @entity2 to push the @entity29 for a political compromise that @entity7 can live with 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the @entity187 were enthusiastic at first about stopping the @entity29 -- but in his visit to @entity6 last week , @entity187 president @entity188 made it clear that he has prioritized @entity2 - @entity187 trade relations over rivalry in @entity15 , and emphasized a political solution for the @entity15 conflict 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the @entity195 and the @entity196 are still supportive of @entity3 efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist @entity7 in @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 but whether they will go through with it is another matter 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 @entity195 has a long list of problems of its own , including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in @entity206 that it can not afford to lose , but also an eastern border with lawless @entity209 that is increasingly a new front in @entity211 's fight against jihadists 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 it is hard to see how @entity195 general @entity214 can commit troops to a @entity15 campaign that is not a direct threat to @entity195 's security 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the same kind of domestic realities , including the threat from @entity222 , will also prevent @entity196 from any significant contribution to @entity3 military efforts in @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 these hard realities leave @entity7 with two options 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same @entity29 that @entity7 is attacking today 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 alternatively , given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops , @entity7 will have to contemplate a full - scale invasion of @entity15 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 the @entity2 too are faced with stark choices 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 it is beyond @entity6 's ability to tame the @entity15 crisis 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 as tempting as it might be for @entity6 to see the @entity3 bleed in @entity15 , the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the @entity11 will undermine broader regional @entity2 interests 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
 a political compromise that both @entity7 and @entity6 and their respective @entity15 allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic 	@entity247 : tensions between @entity2 and @placeholder are at an unprecedented level
