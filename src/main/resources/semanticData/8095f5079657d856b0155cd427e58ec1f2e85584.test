( @entity2 ) the world 's seventh - largest economy is heading toward collapse 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
5 trillion , is under assault 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 however , i am not referring to one of the @entity11 economies , but to the " super economy " of the ocean 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a @entity19 report released thursday , reviving the @entity20 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the @entity24 built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the @entity27 of the @entity28 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 that may seem like a far - off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 and that is not all 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the ocean is truly too big to fail 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well - being 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 also , negotiators meeting in @entity115 later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 reviving the @entity20 is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some ( potential ) good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 many local examples -- from the @entity148 to the @entity149 , from the @entity151 archipelago to the @entity152 -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable - use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
 after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces 	@entity175 economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : @placeholder report
