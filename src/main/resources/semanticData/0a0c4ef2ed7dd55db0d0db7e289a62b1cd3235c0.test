( @entity0 ) -- new tests suggest how a contaminant in heparin -- a blood thinner -- may be connected to dozens of deaths , @entity2 officials said monday 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 @entity8 , a @entity9 health official , says he doubts @entity9 is to blame for the heparin problem 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 the @entity2 has " now established a mechanism by which we think this contaminant could cause these adverse events , " said dr	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 @entity11 , director of the @entity2 's @entity12 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 she said contaminated shipments of the blood thinner have been traced from @entity9 to 10 countries , including the @entity20 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " contamination of the heparin supply is a worldwide problem , " she said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 heparin containing oversulfated chondroitin sulfate -- a compound made from animal cartilage -- has been associated with hundreds of serious adverse symptoms , including allergic reactions that cause nausea , vomiting , shortness of breath and a severe drop in blood pressure 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 in addition , the @entity2 has tallied 81 deaths related to those symptoms in the @entity20 , though no causal link has been determined 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 the severe reactions seem to be related to patients who were given high doses of the drug , @entity11 said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 she said she would not detail the suspected problems with the contaminant in heparin until the information is published in scientific literature and other researchers have had a chance to weigh in on the matter 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 contaminated heparin has been discovered in @entity9 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity20 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 @entity60 and the @entity20 are the only countries that have linked adverse events to the drug , but cases in other countries may have gone unnoticed , @entity11 said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 still , agency officials stressed monday that they can not be sure the deaths are linked to the drug , which is made from pig intestines and is given to prevent clot formation 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " we are not able to rule out the fact that there could be other problems leading to these adverse events , " @entity11 said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 earlier monday , @entity9 officials said they were doubtful a contaminant in heparin was responsible for the bad reactions , according to @entity79 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 they said the contamination might have occurred in the @entity20 during the manufacturing process or patients may have had conditions that caused the symptoms 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant

 @entity85 explain the controversy over heparin Â» " we are aware that our @entity9 colleagues are skeptical that such a link has been established , " @entity11 said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " we are hoping for further scientific dialogue with them in the next few weeks to present the data 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " the raw ingredient for heparin sold by @entity96 and ordered recalled came from @entity97 , a @entity98 company that owns @entity99 the @entity2 posted on its web site a warning letter to @entity99 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 the letter said the company has not instituted proper safeguards to ensure the raw materials are free of impurities 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " you fail to have adequate systems for evaluating the suppliers of heparin crude materials , and the crude materials themselves to ensure that these materials are acceptable for use , " the letter said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 it also cited equipment used in the manufacture of heparin as " unsuitable for intended use 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " for example , it said , tanks used to make heparin " were identified as clean , " but " unidentified material was observed adhering to the inside surfaces 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " shipments of the company 's materials made at the plant will be refused admission into the @entity20 until the matter is corrected , the letter said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " we regret @entity2 's decision to send a warning letter to @entity99 , and we do not believe that the warning letter reflects @entity99 's actual state of compliance with current good manufacturing practices , " @entity97 said in a written statement 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 it added that it is " committed to cooperating with @entity2 and will promptly provide a detailed response 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " in a written statement , @entity96 said its tests confirmed that the contaminant can cause drops in blood pressure , the most commonly reported adverse event 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " that means that the contaminant , which was introduced at the workshop of consolidator level , before it reached our @entity153 [ active pharmaceutical ingredient ] supplier and before it reached @entity96 , is likely the cause of the increased adverse reactions to the heparin , " said @entity147 , the company 's chief scientific officer 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 because no method existed to test for the contaminant , the @entity2 last month developed one , and regulators are now confident current @entity20 supplies of the drug are safe , @entity11 said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 it remains unclear where the contamination occurred , but the contaminated products ' active pharmaceutical ingredient came from 12 @entity9 makers of crude heparin " across a broad area of @entity9 , " she said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 the most persuasive evidence implicating the @entity9 product , she said , is the fact that the increased number of deaths reported after heparin administration returned to baseline in march , after the @entity2 recall 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 though @entity9 officials have raised the possibility that clean and safe heparin may have also been linked to adverse events , @entity11 discounted that 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " we tested this lot and found contamination , " she said 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
 " in their testing , they did not find contamination , but we are fairly certain because of multiple labs doing the testing that this lot contains contaminants 	@placeholder reports 81 @entity20 deaths from symptoms possibly linked to contaminant
