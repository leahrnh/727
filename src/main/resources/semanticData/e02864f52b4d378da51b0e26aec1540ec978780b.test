editor 's note : this is an excerpt from @entity5 contributor @entity4 's new book , " @entity6 : a @entity7 , " a memoir of his time working at an @entity12 newspaper in the 1960s 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 the localness of what we did down at the paper defined everything 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 even as a kid brand - new to the staff and brand - new to the newspaper business , hired to work during summer vacations , i could tell that 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 @entity4 recalls a 1967 lesson in manners from @entity28 football coach @entity27 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 it was a localness not confined to the geographic scope of our news coverage -- it went without saying that the @entity34 , @entity12 , @entity33 was n't about to send its reporters to @entity36 or @entity37 ( or even to @entity38 or @entity39 ) 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 the men and women in the city room arrived at work each day knowing that they were n't going to be assigned to anyplace from where they could n't drive back to the office by deadline 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 the localness extended beyond that , though , and infused the very feel of the place 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 one night in the summer of 1967 the phone on the sports desk rang and i picked it up with the customary : " @entity55 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " the person on the other end said : " now , that 's no way to answer a telephone , is it 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " " who 's calling 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " to whom am i speaking 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " this is @entity4 , " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " now , i 've seen your name in the paper , " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " it 's @entity4 , is n't it 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " i had been permitted to write a few sports stories that summer ; i used the " jr	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " at the end of the byline 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " yes , " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 i thought i recognized the voice from somewhere 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " now , i believe i know your mother and father , " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " are your parents @entity81 and @entity82 , from @entity83 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " " yes , " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " i know they did n't raise you to answer a phone that way , " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " when you answer a business telephone , the proper way to do it is to tell the caller your name first 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " " all right , sir , " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " i know your parents are fine people , and i 'm sure they taught you good manners , " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " you do n't want to disappoint them by giving a bad impression of yourself on the telephone , do you 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " " no , sir , " i said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " good , " the caller said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " now , this is @entity27 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 i was calling to speak with @entity101 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 is @entity101 there , please 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " and , my hands shaking , i connected him with @entity104 , one of the paper 's sportswriters 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 i knew it really was the head coach of the @entity28 football team because of that phrase early in his lecture to me -- " to whom am i speaking 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " his grammar was always scrupulous -- no " who am i speaking to 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " from @entity27 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 the localness was all around us 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 @entity27 had met my mother and father on a few occasions , he remembered them , and he was setting their son straight 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 he may have been the most nationally famous person in the community , but he was first and foremost a member of that community -- during all his years as head football coach at @entity28 , @entity27 kept his home telephone number listed in the @entity34 phone book : @entity131 , on @entity132 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 that made for a lot of late - night crank calls from a lot of insulting or drunken people , but he thought that if he was going to represent the community , then he should be as available as any other man or woman in town 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 once , years later , i heard a story -- i 'm almost certain that it was @entity33 sportswriter @entity144 who told it 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 it seemed that very early in @entity148 's golf career , @entity148 's father , @entity150 , a @entity34 pharmacist , was following his son on tour , and @entity27 offered to travel with @entity153 to keep him company and provide moral support 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 apparently at one tournament someone in the gallery kept referring to @entity148 as " @entity159 " -- @entity148 was a little hefty in those younger days 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 and , the way i remember the story , either @entity27 had to physically restrain @entity153 from going after the fan , or @entity153 had to restrain @entity27 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 ( i have a feeling i know which one was which 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 ) it was all part of the localness 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 @entity27 and @entity153 were two @entity34 residents on the road to cheer for a local golfer ; the fact that the local golfer would become the greatest ever to play the game was incidental 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 and we -- in the eyes of our readers , and in our own eyes , too -- were , proudly , the local paper 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 that was all , and everything , we aspired to be 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 just like the proud local papers in a thousand other @entity183 towns 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 " i know they did n't raise you to answer a phone that way , " @entity27 said 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 he thought , by saying it , he was doing me a favor 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
 he was 	author recalls lesson in etiquette from @placeholder 's football coach
