( @entity0 ) -- monday is the second day of the year , which means millions of @entity2 have started new diets 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 they resolved to lose weight , get in shape , and they are starting strong 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 sadly , the odds are that almost all of these resolutions will soon be broken and abandoned 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 close to half of all dieters end up heavier than ever 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 virtually none will lose weight permanently 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 the same is true for the country as a whole 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 obesity has become the country 's leading public health problem 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 yet as we talk and talk about the issue , the country only becomes fatter and fatter 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 the problem for the country echoes the problem for individuals : willpower is not enough 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 " ( it 's a ) basic instinct , even stronger than the sexual instinct , to store calories to survive the next period of starvation 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 and we live in an environment where there 's food every half mile 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 it 's tasty , cheap , convenient , and you can eat it with one hand 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 " thus says @entity39 of the @entity40 at @entity41 in @entity42 , author of one of the many studies on the limits of dieting , quoted in @entity48 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 if you as an individual want to change your weight , you must change your whole life 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 likewise , to reduce obesity in modern society , we will have to alter the way society is organized 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 weight gain is driven by two trends : increases in calories consumed and decrease in calories expended 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 @entity62 induces both 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 for example : the after - inflation cost of sugary soda has declined by an estimated 48 % over the past 20 years 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 correspondingly , consumption of sugary soda has soared : sugary soda is now the single most important source of calories in the @entity2 diet 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 for example again : the number of @entity2 who work at physically taxing jobs continues its steady decline 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 even those jobs that demand physical labor -- manufacturing , for example -- are much less grueling than they used to be , as electrically powered machines do the lifting and shifting that used to consume human energy 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 while @entity2 expend fewer calories at work , they spend more time in cars -- almost twice as much as in the 1970s 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 they spend 26 hours per week consuming tv or online entertainment 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 americans could theoretically compensate for more sedentary lifestyles by stepping up their recreational exercise -- but only about 20 % of @entity2 bother 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 some 80 % never do -- including presumably all those failed dieters 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 want to change this 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 it 's no small project 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 it would involve the redesign of cities , the relocation of schools , the reinvention of our modes of eating and amusement 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 first lady @entity104 has made healthy eating her special project 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 good for her , and let 's hope her efforts lead to success 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 but if we are to succeed , we should understand : the campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking ( which involves just one decision , to smoke or not to smoke ) and much more like the generation - long campaign against highway fatalities , which required the redesign of cars , the redesign of highways , and changes in personal behavior like seat - belt use and drunk driving 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 the good news is that the campaign against highway fatalities has yielded real progress : down two - thirds since the mid- 1960s 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 the bad news is that , for most of us , it will take more than a @entity134 's resolution 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 however , if you are seriously resolved , congratulations -- and see you on the jogging path 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 	@placeholder is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
