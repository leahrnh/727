( @entity0 ) i 'm haunted by the video of officer @entity3 firing eight shots at @entity5 as he fled his encounter with @entity8 police -- his back turned to the officer 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen @entity5 and allows him to die face - down in the dirt while @entity3 appears to plant an item next to his body 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 i understand why people are skeptical of self - defense claims -- especially from law enforcement 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 if not for the video taken by a bystander , i ca n't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 as a defense attorney , i am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime , but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 thank @entity38 there was a camera 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 it will help ensure that justice will be served in this case 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 however , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 throughout the entire encounter with @entity5 , it 's clear @entity3 had no idea someone was filming him 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 had he known there would be video of his every move , would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 would he have fired 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 eight times 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 of course not 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 if @entity3 had been wearing a body camera , @entity5 would probably still be alive , and @entity3 would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 body cameras are expensive to deploy , sure 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 and storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 that cost , however -- if we 're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to @entity5 's family in an inevitable civil suit against the @entity75 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 most importantly , we have to ask ourselves this : what 's the value of a human life 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 certainly it 's worth the price of some mass data storage 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 and there 's something else at stake 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 the public is losing confidence in law enforcement , and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 as fear ratchets up , so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 as tension rises , the risk of more shootings increases 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 it is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 police body cameras can help break this cycle 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 complaints against cops decrease , and , most importantly , use - of - force incidents drop 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 i will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 they only help compensate for the real underlying problem , which is this : there is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system , and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 when we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other @entity135 officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver 's license -- it 's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 these may not be overtly racist cops 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 they may not intentionally treat black men differently , but we ca n't pretend that black men are n't being disproportionately targeted 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 all across the country , we see it happening , and with the proliferation of video , we 're seeing it happen with alarming frequency 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 somehow , we 're going to have to beat this bias out of our system 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 @entity155 more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 as a society , we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income , education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 but social change , sadly , may take generations of hard work 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
 in the meantime , if we ca n't immediately root out racial bias , we can at least put a bright spotlight on it , and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body - mounted cameras on cops 	@entity180 : @entity181 captured @entity3 shooting @placeholder ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
