( @entity0 ) -- it 's a simple thing , really , the rubber and stainless steel band that a well - known ceo frequently wears around his wrist 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 but the @entity6 that @entity8 's @entity7 has been seen sporting at multiple public events is just one clue about a possible deal between @entity8 and @entity11 that could be part of the sales pitch when a rumored @entity8 watch hits the market 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 late on friday ( the traditional time of the week for companies to release bad news ) , came a news report that @entity11 had laid off much of the team responsible for the @entity19 and would not continue to update the line of wearable gadgets , which measure physical activity and monitor things like heart rate and calories burned 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 @entity11 had planned to release a new , thinner @entity19 in the fall , but those plans have reportedly been shelved and the company wo n't say whether there will be a new one 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 @entity11 has said it plans to continue supporting the current @entity19 for the " forseeable future " and that new color options will be available 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 still , the retreat seems odd for a company that has made its name in sports equipment -- and has led to speculations that @entity11 may be working on a new partnership with @entity8 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " obviously @entity8 has enjoyed a healthy relationship with them over the years , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 analyst who follows @entity8 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " our view has been that the fitness band will largely fold into the smartwatch in the future and most of the players will exit the market 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 if i were them , makes more sense to partner with @entity8 , but that is just my opinion 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " @entity11 spokesman @entity56 said in an email that @entity19 remains " an important part " of @entity11 's business 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 he confirmed there will be a " small number " of layoffs and emphasized the company 's continuing work on digital products , including partnerships with companies like @entity8 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " partnering with industry - leading tech companies is nothing new for @entity11 , " @entity56 said 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " we have been working with @entity8 to develop products since 2006 , when the two companies introduced @entity11 + running , and @entity11 has since create apps for the @entity74 including @entity11 , @entity75 + @entity19 and @entity75 + move which launched in @entity76 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " building on these successful products and services , @entity11 and @entity8 are partnering on emerging technologies to create better solutions for athletes 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 " could that partnership evolve into a forthcoming @entity8 - @entity11 wearable product 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 that is still just conjecture at this point 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 but consider : -- already , @entity8 's @entity74 system is the only mobile system that can be used with the @entity88 and its set of apps 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 -- @entity7 has sat on @entity11 's board of directors for the past nine years 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 and the two companies have already teamed up to create the @entity11 + mobile app for iphones and ipods 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 -- in september , @entity8 hired @entity11 's @entity96 , the man behind the " @entity97 " that created @entity88 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 -- @entity8 is the highest - profile company that has not yet entered the wearable tech field -- despite the fact that rumors of an " @entity102 " have been swirling for years 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 with @entity104 , @entity105 and other competitors already selling wearable gear , it would make sense for @entity8 to get into the game sooner rather than later 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 @entity8 's @entity110 is set to begin on june 2 , and the company has used the event in the past to announce new products 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 alternately , @entity8 has made a habit of introducing a new iphone every fall , in advance of the holiday shopping season 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 it would certainly make sense to unveil a new product then as well 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
 @entity8 did not reply to a message seeking comment for this story 	the companies have ties , from @placeholder ceo on down
