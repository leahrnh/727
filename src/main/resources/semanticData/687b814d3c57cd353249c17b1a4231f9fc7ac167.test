( @entity3 ) the listeria outbreak that prompted @entity1 to recall their entire product line dates to 2010 , according to the @entity4 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 after weeks of gradual recalls , the company recalled all its ice cream , frozen yogurt , sherbet and other frozen treats sold in 23 states because they could be contaminated with @entity15 monocytogenes , the company said monday 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , the elderly and others with weak immune systems 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the @entity4 recommends consumers do not eat any @entity1 brand products 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 three people in @entity25 have died in the past year and 10 people in four states have fallen ill from the bacteria believed to have come from @entity1 products , the @entity4 said tuesday 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 one person became sick in @entity31 , five in @entity25 , one in @entity32 and three in @entity33 , the @entity4 said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 people first became sick in january 2010 , the @entity4 said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the agency connected patients from 2010 - 2015 to the current outbreak through comparisons to a database of bacteria @entity40 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the origin of the strain is still unknown , but " the fact that it was the same strain over the last five years suggests it could have lurked somewhere in the factory the whole time , " said dr	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity47 , deputy director of the @entity4 @entity48 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity47 said there may be more people sickened by listeria than the @entity4 knows about 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the " rough estimate " is one more case exists for every case the @entity4 hears about , he said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " there may be cases that never got diagnosed and we are looking at the patterns , the dna patterns , to guide us to which cases might be related , " he said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " if tomorrow someone found another completely different pattern from ( @entity1 ) ice cream products , we 'd be looking to see if there were related cases to that as well 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity47 said the listeria strains found in @entity33 are different than those found in @entity32 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " it looks to us like there was one group of closely related strains related to ice cream from one factory and another different group related to a different factory , " @entity47 said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " we do n't think something contaminated both factories 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity1 decided to yank all its products after tests showed some half - gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream contained listeria 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " this means @entity1 has now had several positive tests for @entity15 in different places and plants , " the company said in a written statement 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " at this point , we can not say with certainty how @entity15 was introduced to our facilities , and so we have taken this unprecedented step , " the company said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity15 : what is it , how do you get it , and what 's the risk 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity15 did n't get into ice cream through the milk because @entity1 uses pasteurized milk , @entity102 , director of food safety for @entity104 , told @entity3 on tuesday 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 but listeria could have been carried on foods like nuts that go into ice cream , she said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 it can live for years on surfaces such as drains or pipes 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity15 can lay in a drain for years , " she said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " to get rid of it they 'd have to take the equipment apart and clean it 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 it 's a big job to control listeria in a plant 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity47 said , " within the factories it can get around and may have hung out and appeared in more than one place in the factory 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the persistence of listeria inside the factory is what 's important to address 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity102 said the listeria probably was n't linked to @entity1 in 2010 because one case would n't spark a full investigation 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 other culprits , such as cheeses and deli meats , would be considered before ice cream products , because listeria ca n't grow in frozen temperatures , she said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " ice cream would n't have been one of the suspect foods in investigating those earlier cases , " she said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 the @entity25 @entity145 and @entity146 said three people in the state died from listeria there over the past year , possibly due to @entity1 products 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 all five of the people who got sick in @entity25 were patients being treated at the same hospital for unrelated causes , state health officials said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 four of them drank milkshakes at the hospital made with @entity1 ice cream , the @entity4 said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 it 's not clear whether the fifth patient at the @entity25 hospital had also consumed @entity1 ice cream 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 in a separate outbreak in @entity33 , three patients were infected with listeria between 2011 and 2014 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 tests of those listeria strains " were nearly identical to @entity15 strains isolated from ice cream produced at the @entity1 ' @entity32 facility , " the @entity4 said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 in march , @entity1 recalled 3 - ounce cups of chocolate , vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test found listeria in one of the cups in @entity25 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 earlier this month , the recall expanded to some pints and half - gallon sizes of ice cream 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 this recall is not only affecting big chain grocery stores 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 one small ice cream shop in @entity33 has temporarily closed due to the recall 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity185 , owner of @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity33 , said he exclusively uses @entity1 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 he received a phone call monday night from @entity1 letting him know a local driver will be picking up his 190 - 200 gallons of recalled ice cream this week 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " it is the third recall in the last month , " said @entity185 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " i was upset , but more disappointed 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " the shop owner has dealt with a shortage in flavors before , but nothing of his severity 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " it will be at least three , maybe four weeks for @entity1 to replace the order , " he said 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems , the @entity200 says 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 in the @entity208 , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill with listeria each year ; about 16 % of these cases result in death 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 although some people might suffer only short - term symptoms such as high fever , severe headache , nausea , abdominal pain and diarrhea , listeria can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 @entity1 ceo and president @entity223 promised to make sure all products are safe before they go back on sale 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " we 're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing , and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe , " @entity223 said in a statement on the company 's website 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " we are heartbroken about this situation and apologize to all of our loyal @entity1 fans and customers 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
 " @entity1 said its new safety measures will include more extensive cleaning and sanitizing of equipment ; increasing the swabbing and testing of facility surfaces by 800 % ; providing more employee training ; and sending samples to a lab for testing every day 	@placeholder says 3 people died from bacteria believed to have come from @entity1
