as the opening of next month 's @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , approaches , the controversies surrounding the games seem to accumulate by the day 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 these have included criticism of @entity5 's human rights record , particularly its treatment of homosexuals , its environmental policies and , with the recent suicide bombings in @entity14 , its anti-terrorism actions and strategy in the @entity17 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 calls to boycott the games and other international pressure have led @entity5 to release high - profile dissidents including @entity22 , the ex-oil tycoon , and members of the punk band @entity25 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 yet for all the heat generated in these controversies , one of the most significant issues of all surrounding the @entity3 has been nearly ignored : recognition of the indigenous people of @entity4 , the @entity31 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the @entity31 , who are mostly @entity33 , resided in @entity4 for millennia 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 in the 19th century , an expanding @entity35 coveted their territory -- which is south and east of @entity5 proper -- and used overwhelming force to defeat them 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 @entity5 killed around 1	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
5 million @entity31 and expelled a similar number , mostly to the @entity40 , with many dying of famine and disease 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 entire tribes were decimated ; for example , the @entity46 tribe was reduced from 300,000 to 3,000 people 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the bloodiest battle of all , which @entity31 refer to as their " last stand , " occurred in the vicinity of @entity4 , the @entity31 capital , in 1864 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the @entity31 describe the catastrophe that befell their people as the first modern genocide 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the few @entity31 able to remain in the @entity17 found themselves a minority in their own land , which was quickly settled by @entity5 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 those who were expelled or escaped were forced to migrate from country to country in search of safety and stability 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 @entity64 @entity31 have faced huge challenges in attempting to preserve their identity and traditions and keep the memory of their homeland alive 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 when it was announced that @entity4 would host the @entity72 , there was an outcry among @entity31 , who were profoundly insulted that the games would be staged on the graves of their ancestors , almost exactly 150 years after the @entity4 " last stand 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 " @entity31 launched global campaigns of protest amidst reports of human remains being discovered at @entity84 construction sites 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the @entity31 complained of intimidation by the @entity5 , who , for example , last month arrested eight prominent @entity31 activists in the @entity17 , all of whom were respected public figures 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the @entity31 found it intolerable not only that @entity4 was selected to host the @entity3 , but also that @entity5 did not seem to acknowledge that @entity31 even lived there 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 when president @entity93 delivered his bid for the games in a speech to the @entity97 in 2007 , he said that the @entity4 area used to be inhabited by ancient @entity99 and did not mention the @entity31 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 this is noteworthy because not only did the @entity31 live in the region at the time of the @entity99 and maintain close ties with them , but they actually participated in the original olympic games 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 @entity5 's indifference towards its indigenous people sharply contrasts with @entity108 's policy at the last @entity3 in @entity109 in 2010 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 then , for the first time in history , the native peoples of the area were made official hosts of the @entity3 and were involved in every aspect of the games 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 a depiction of an inukshuk , an indigenous landmark and symbol , was featured as the official logo of the @entity3 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 the governments of @entity108 and @entity123 contributed millions of dollars to centers that educated visitors about indigenous culture and history 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 other recent @entity3 , for example in @entity128 in 2002 , also prominently featured the native peoples of that area 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 despite @entity5 's failures on the @entity31 issue , @entity93 still has time to act 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 he has already taken the crucial step of allowing protests at the @entity3 , and protesters , circassian and otherwise , must be allowed to freely express themselves to the world 's media 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 @entity93 can also push for an acknowledgement of the @entity31 at the opening ceremony and speak on the issue 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 a serious and sincere acknowledgment of the @entity31 would help demonstrate to the world that @entity93 is serious about his vision of a modern and multiethnic " new @entity5 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 " the @entity143 and @entity144 have officially apologized for the horrors they inflicted on indigenous peoples , and by taking positive action at the @entity72 , @entity5 can move in a similar direction 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 perhaps such a gesture of respect could help the nation find a solution to the festering problem of the @entity17 , where areas to the east of @entity4 , such as @entity156 and @entity157 , remain in a state of war and hopelessness 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 it is impossible to bring back the mass numbers of @entity31 killed at @entity4 and the surrounding region in the 19th century 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 what @entity5 , and all of us , can do is remember and honor them 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
 by doing so , we affirm the important role that indigenous peoples must play in the 21st century , and also help ensure that the destruction of an entire people never happens again 	@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @placeholder
