( @entity0 ) saturday at the masters , like any @entity3 tournament , has been dubbed ' @entity4 ' 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 it 's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 players rose and players fell away on @entity4 at the 2015 masters 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 @entity13 went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd 's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable @entity17 on sunday night 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 but he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 woods comeback 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 a rejuvenated @entity22 showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 a huge improvement , but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " it could have been a super low today , " a disappointed @entity22 said after his round 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " all in all 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 it should have been two shots better 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " @entity33 powered around the course , threatening to challenge too , finishing on eleven under 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 as did a late @entity36 surge , where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 in the end , there was lots of moving , but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble @entity44 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 @entity46 the 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at @entity50 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 his infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from @entity52 , @entity53 a five shot lead going in to the third round 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 that has happened only three times at @entity50 before , and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 @entity44 's 15 birdies are just 10 away from @entity33 's masters mark set in 2001 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 he could also break @entity22 270 set in 1997 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 as it happened , @entity44 played a steady , almost conservative round 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 when he made the occasional mistake , like the bogey at 15 , he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 as his third round came to a close the birdies flowed , his putting impeccable 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 the only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 echos of 1996 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 when reminded of some of the great @entity50 comebacks , including @entity79 's 11 shot swing in 1996 , @entity22 still believes anything is possible 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " it really is , " he said 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " we saw what happened in 1996 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 you never know 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 it depends on the conditions 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 " he is , of course , right 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 as @entity90 knows only too well , anything can happen on the final day 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 but that kind of crescendo also depends on @entity44 experiencing a @entity90 - style meltdown 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 @entity44 's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 yet , for all the movement of @entity33 , @entity22 , @entity101 and @entity13 , they made just a one shot dent into @entity44 's second round lead 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
 he will begin sunday four shots ahead 	@placeholder holds lead in 2015 masters
