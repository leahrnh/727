( @entity3 ) on april 20 , 2010 , a final cement seal of an oil well in the @entity2 failed , causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in @entity7 history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 for 87 straight days , oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead , 1 mile below the surface of the ocean 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 the federal government estimated 4	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
2 million barrels of oil spilled into the @entity2 , but @entity18 argued in court that it was much lower 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 a judge ruled @entity18 was responsible for the release of 3	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
1 million barrels 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 imagining @entity23 : a rig worker 's daughter and her dreams there were dire predictions of what would follow 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 scientists continue to study environmental impacts , but five years after the spill , the long - term negative effects remain unclear and are , in many cases , highly disputed 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity18 , the company that caused the spill , is eager to point out it appears the @entity2 is healing itself 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity18 's vice president of communications , @entity40 , said there is no doubt birds , fish , turtles , sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill

 " there 's no question about that , " @entity40 said 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " but they have also , according to the data , bounced back and are recovering strongly 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " " and there is no data that suggests there are any long - term population - level impacts to any species 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " while @entity18 's assessment has not been disproven , the government suggests it 's too soon to make long - term conclusions about the rebounding health of the @entity2 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 shortly after @entity18 released its own five - year report that concluded the @entity2 has largely recovered , the trustees of the @entity70 called @entity18 's report " inappropriate as well as premature 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " the trustees , a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the @entity79 spill , released a statement , saying , " we know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " one government official familiar with the trustee 's assessment accused @entity18 of having " cherry - picked " positive results while ignoring others , something @entity18 denies 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 most long - term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill , but others show some of those species are bouncing back 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 fish landings in the @entity2 , the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry , have returned 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 oysters are also recovering in many areas 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 and according to the @entity108 , tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region 's food supply 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 the spill 's effects on other species are less clear 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the @entity117 , and even more so in @entity118 where the oil hit the hardest 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 but the dolphin " mortality event , " as the government calls it , began months before the spill 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like @entity127 , @entity118 , could be caused by oil exposure , but direct links to the 2010 @entity79 spill have not been proven 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 seaside sparrows in the @entity2 are also showing signs of strain , and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 while aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters , government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long - term effects on sea turtle populations 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 but perhaps the greatest unknown is what , if anything , millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the @entity2 itself 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the @entity79 as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity158 , an oceanographer with the @entity159 , has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 her research and other studies show @entity18 's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 according to @entity158 's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity158 is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " that stuff 's not going to stay put 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 it 's going to move around , " @entity158 said 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 she said that right now , there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " there 's so much that we do n't know , " @entity158 said 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity18 does n't accept the results of @entity158 's work 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 the company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places : within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 and according to @entity18 's @entity40 , the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " so much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life , " @entity40 said 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity207 conservationist @entity206 witnessed much of the spill 's aftermath in 2010 , but when he returned to the @entity2 to dive near an oil rig last month , he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks , hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 during the same trip , however , @entity206 spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 it is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 @entity206 commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill , but he said he believes it 's far too early to say the @entity2 is back and the oil is gone 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " it is still in many cases in the sand , along the shoreline , in the marshes , " @entity206 said , " and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
 " @entity3 's @entity238 contributed to this report 	april 20 marks 5 years since the @placeholder oil spill
