( @entity0 ) -- when " @entity3 " hit movie screens in 1987 , audiences flocked to see the true story of singer @entity5 , who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 " @entity3 " starred @entity8 as singer @entity5 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 it 's one of 40 films featured in the festival 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 but it was memorable for another reason 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 the film was the first box office hit directed by a @entity17 filmmaker and starring mostly @entity17 actors , said @entity19 , a professor of cinema and media studies at the @entity22 , @entity23 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 " @entity3 " is part of the @entity25 in @entity11 , which begins tuesday and runs through may on @entity26 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 the event features 40 films that show how latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network 's " @entity34 " series 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 ( @entity26 , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity35 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 ) @entity19 , who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival , talked with @entity0 about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line - up 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 watch clips from some of the classic films Â» the following is a edited version of that interview 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : what was your selection process 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : i decided i was going to focus specifically on @entity52 films that look substantively at either @entity17 characters or the @entity17 community 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 i came up with a master list of films , and it 's only about 70 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 there really have n't been that many that have dealt explicitly with the @entity17 population 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 and then , from there , we looked at what was available 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : when you talk about @entity17 images , who do you include in that description 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : it 's a kind of pan-ethnic , multiracial category 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 but basically in terms of the series , what it reflects is @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 there really have n't been , as far as i can tell , many @entity52 films that go beyond those three major groups 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : what do you hope to accomplish with this movie lineup 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : by and large , these are films that really have n't been seen since their original release 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 we really do n't have an idea of what the history has been in terms of how @entity52 has dealt with or represented what is now a pretty sizeable part of our population 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 we have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within westerns or action films , background characters like maids 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : what do you mean by expendable characters 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : if i 'm watching a science - fiction film and there happens to be a @entity17 character , i know that that character is going to be the first one to die 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 ( laughs ) it is almost inevitable 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 or in a @entity116 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 they 're really not there as characters ; they 're there as foils for the largely white characters that are defining the film and the story 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 to my mind , it 's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just @entity52 but our society was trying to figure out where @entity133 fit within the national culture 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : as people watch these movies , from very early @entity52 to the 1990s , what is the progression of @entity17 characters 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : i do n't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 you see certain recurring figures or types 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 you see different versions of the gangster kind of morphing into the gang member 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 but it 's more or less an urban outlaw type , and that persists 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 i think you see little shifts in terms of when they 're being made and who is making them 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 you have some of the same characters in " @entity162 / @entity162 , " but it 's being made by a @entity165 filmmaker as part of an attempt to show a very diverse view of what a family can be 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : what 's your take on white actors playing @entity17 characters 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : actually , [ co-host ] @entity174 and i kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because i think there are two views 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 one is : actors are actors , and they play make - believe , and they pretend to be different types of characters , and in an ideal world , actors should be able to play anything they are able to do effectively 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 but when you look at it sociologically , you see it 's only working one way , and that 's where i think there 's a problem 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 in the history of @entity52 , we 're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on @entity17 characters , family or community , and a third of those have white actors playing the @entity133 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 and @entity17 actors are not really getting the same opportunity to play other types 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity0 : how did the industry try to " transform " actors into @entity17 characters 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : the @entity17 population -- and it 's part of the irony of this -- it 's not a racial group 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 it 's a multiracial , multi-ethnic group 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 we talk about that in terms of " @entity220 , " where everybody 's identified how @entity222 was in brownface playing a @entity76 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 but in 1980 , there was a revival of it on @entity226 , and they actually cast a @entity76 actress 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 in the makeup room , they started putting brownface on her , [ because ] she was n't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a @entity236 character would look like on stage 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 i 've done focus groups with @entity17 actors in the @entity241 , and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a @entity17 character is going to look like and more often than not , @entity17 actors do n't look like that 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 ( laughs ) @entity0 : what do you think about how latinos are portrayed in film today 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 @entity19 : we have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known , who are included in films , not always starring , but they get secondary roles in films and so there 's in some sense more of a presence 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 when you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of @entity133 in film and television , the numbers really have n't changed that much 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
 so it 's a kind of a subtle shift 	scholar : films show how @entity52 tried to figure out where @placeholder fit in culture
