@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- when @entity4 won the @entity6 presidential election in 2008 , people in @entity0 exchanged congratulatory text messages 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 as he delivered his famous " yes we can " victory speech in @entity9 , people in @entity0 eagerly watched the entire live telecast , cheering or exclaiming every sentence 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 some ended up crying tears of joy 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 's melodramatic response to @entity6 politics was exclusive to that time 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 it was , and still is , an exception rather than the rule 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 postcard : @entity20 places little faith in election so far , this year 's @entity6 election has only featured in the international news segment of flagship bulletins , the inside pages of @entity28 - language newspapers , and the occasional mention on late - night current affairs programs 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 it is not something people discuss with friends and colleagues 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 some feel compelled , because of the nature of their work , to stay informed of world events 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 there are some whose interests are tied to the decisions made in @entity44 are the only people who follow the @entity6 election story 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 the people of whom i speak can loosely be termed the " civil society " of @entity0 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 they are well - meaning people , but people who mean different things 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 there are students and teachers among them , leftists , modern islamists , artists and writers , business people and professionals , people who want a revolution in @entity1 now and people who are resigned to the fact that it 's not happening in their lifetime -- and they are very few in number 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 postcard : " ignore us at your peril , " @entity67 say for the middle and lower middle - class majority of @entity0 , the @entity6 presidential race is only of marginal interest 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 the man on @entity0 's streets is fairly clear in his conviction that the @entity6 is one , or several , of the following : the @entity78 , the bully , the flag carrier of brutal capitalism , the enemy of @entity83 , the friend and benefactor of @entity86 , the blinding light of modernity , the abyss of moral depravity , the ugly face of imperialism , and other epithets given from the pulpit of mosques , pronounced on street banners and graffiti , and echoed in op - ed pages of urdu - language newspapers 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 it is a measure of success for the anti- @entity6 agenda that the public hatred for @entity6 overrides facts as conveniently today as it did in the 1980s 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 postcard : @entity106 fear what follows @entity6 election when @entity110 's novel " @entity111 " came out -- and was promptly banned by @entity1 -- thousands of people vented their anger against the @entity115 author of @entity117 ancestry ( whose book was published in @entity119 ) by demonstrating at the @entity6 mission in @entity0 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 when some " hurtful " cartoons are published in @entity123 , a few @entity121 will be burnt down in @entity124 and @entity125 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 when a man purported to be a @entity127 based in the @entity6 makes a cheap spoof of a film about @entity83 -- presumably to stoke the fire of religious hatred in @entity132 -- two dozen @entity1 die during the ensuing protests , trying to reach @entity6 diplomatic and cultural missions in the country 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 are also quite resigned to the fact that the government in @entity0 -- which is led alternately by the right - leaning @entity138 or the " progressive " @entity139 ( @entity139 ) -- is always more loyal to the @entity6 than its own people , and that every @entity6 government -- be it @entity142 or @entity143 -- always supports the military or civilian despots in @entity0 and is therefore always pitted against the common @entity1 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 but then 2008 was different 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 postcard : should @entity6 raise fist to @entity148 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 had just gotten rid of general @entity149 , and had voted in a @entity139 - led coalition government 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 politicians of all shades were speaking as one for the common man ; reconciliation , consensus , and change were the buzzwords 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 democracy was being touted as the best revenge against undemocratic forces 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 a mass movement , led by lawyers , sought the restoration to office of nearly 60 superior court judges who had been placed under house arrest by @entity149 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 the movement was gaining momentum and it seemed only a matter of days before the rule of law was established 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 come the election in november and the wind of change blew in the faraway @entity6 as well 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 the unthinkable happened 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity4 -- a black , first generation immigrant -- had been elected to lead the sole superpower 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 for @entity1 , the timing and the lead - up to @entity4 's victory was too tempting to be ignored as just a coincidence 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 was changing , and the @entity6 was changing -- for the better 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 more : get latest news at @entity182 the world was finally going to be peaceful and prosperous for all 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 and what @entity4 said in @entity9 , addressed exclusively to @entity6 , was taken as spoken to @entity1 : " this is our moment 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 this is our time -- to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids , to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 " fast forward to 2012 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 remains in tatters and without hope 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 rampant corruption , pathetic incompetence and callousness towards the plight of the people are the defining attributes of the last episode of @entity1 's " return to democracy , " renewing the public 's cyclical appetite for military rule 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 across seven seas , @entity4 's presidency too has brought disillusionment 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 in the minds of many @entity1 , the @entity6 has proved to be the same two - faced hypocrite they always thought it was -- defending free speech when it comes to @entity219 propaganda like the @entity221 film , yet at the same time condemning anti-semitism and coming down hard on government whistleblowing website @entity223 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 postcard : why @entity117 longs for @entity6 election at the same time , @entity6 - @entity1 relations are at an all - time low 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 here in @entity0 , we are where we have always been : a state living on the edge of being labeled a failure , with a population that largely believes @entity6 is indeed the @entity78 , the bully , the oppressor , working in league with our government and our military , against us 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 change is a mirage , as they say 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity244 is dope 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 life is miserable and death comes cheaply 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 interest in @entity6 elections 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity1 politicians will have a hard time getting people interested in their own elections , due in a few months time 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 @entity4 can win or lose for all @entity1 care , against 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
 what 's the name of his opponent 	@entity256 : @entity0 's " civil society " keeping tabs on upcoming @placeholder election
