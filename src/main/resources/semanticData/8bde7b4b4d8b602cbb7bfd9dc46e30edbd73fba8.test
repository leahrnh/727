( @entity1 ) @entity0 on tuesday launched a two - stage falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called @entity4 on a flight from @entity6 , @entity7 , to the @entity8 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 that was the easy part 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 in a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time , the private space exploration company was unsuccessful 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity0 founder @entity15 tweeted : " ascent successful 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity16 to @entity17 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity18 landed on droneship , but too hard for survival 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 " he later clarified that the rocket landed , but tipped over 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity0 tried to land a @entity23 9 on the drone ship in january , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity0 has said it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 usually booster rockets burn up in @entity34 's atmosphere or , like @entity36 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 so why try to land one 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity15 wants to cut costs 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 on his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to " reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 " what about the rest of the rocket and the @entity4 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 the smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the @entity4 into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in @entity34 's atmosphere 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 @entity4 will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and @entity59 , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 the space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the @entity4 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 they 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to @entity34 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 when they 're done , @entity4 will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the @entity72 off @entity73 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 this is the sixth @entity0 mission to the @entity8 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 the company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 tuesday 's launch was the second attempt for this mission 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
 monday 's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather 	dragon spacecraft will head toward @placeholder on resupply mission
