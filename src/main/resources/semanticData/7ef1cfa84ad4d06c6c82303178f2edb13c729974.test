( @entity1 ) launching rockets is a complicated thing 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 well , that 's never been done before 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity7 , the private space exploration company founded by billionaire @entity8 , hopes to give it a try 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 but weather forced it to scrub monday 's plan to launch 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity7 said on @entity14 that tuesday at 4:10 p	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
m	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 et will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two - stage falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called @entity19 on a flight from @entity21 , @entity22 , to the @entity23 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 that will be the easy part 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 after the launch , @entity7 will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform , or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship , in the @entity32 off @entity22 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 usually booster rockets burn up in @entity36 's atmosphere or , like @entity38 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 so why try to land one 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity8 wants to cut costs 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 on his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to " reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 " @entity7 tried to land a @entity51 9 on the drone ship in january , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 the company has previously said the odds of a successful landing are about 50 % 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 if you want to see how it goes , it will post photos online throughout the mission and will put video on @entity64 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 and if the landing does n't work 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity7 says it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 what about the rest of the rocket and the @entity19 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 the smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the @entity19 into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in @entity36 's atmosphere 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity19 will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and @entity80 , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 the space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the @entity19 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 they 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to @entity36 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 when they 're done , @entity19 will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the @entity93 off @entity94 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 this is the sixth @entity7 mission to the @entity23 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 the company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
 @entity1 's @entity99 contributed to this report 	@placeholder says weather forced it to delay its rocket launch plan
