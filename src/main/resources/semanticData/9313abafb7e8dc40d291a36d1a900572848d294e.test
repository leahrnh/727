 when the earthquake struck , she was getting ready for a group excursion , a canyon swing 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 she could see the ground splitting apart beneath her feet 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 what scared her most was seeing large boulders crashing down from the mountains above 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 she prayed she would n't be crushed 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 she ran from the toppling boulders and shielded herself 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 when the tremors subsided , @entity54 and her friends huddled together and camped on higher ground overnight , expecting to be rescued 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 when three days passed and no one came to their aid , the group decided to take their chances and leave the confines of the resort 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 the walk toward @entity80 was treacherous 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 the roads near the resort were mostly blocked or in bad shape because of a landslide 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 but the worst part was the smell of rotting flesh , which permeated the air as she passed countless villages flattened by the quake 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 " it was a walk of survival , " she said 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 " my brain refused to feel anything apart from putting one leg before the other until the mountains were left behind 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 " @entity54 hiked six hours through mountainous terrain toward @entity2 's capital 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 she was able to connect with her family , nearly four days after the quake , from the airport in @entity80 while waiting for the next flight to @entity46 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 she was exhausted 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 it did n't seem like she had gone through a terrible episode in her life , " he said 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 her brother , @entity125 , got news of the disaster from a friend 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 it was n't until he heard the high casualty figures and reports about the avalanches that he started to get scared 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 he was prepared for the worst , knowing they were traveling to a @entity135 base camp in @entity2 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 but that was basically all he knew 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 @entity125 combed through what little information his sister left for him before the trip , but it did n't include the name of the tour group or the hotel where they were staying 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 he took to social media and started emailing and calling hiking groups that operated in @entity2 , but no one was getting back to him 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 on sunday , he managed to get inside his sister 's apartment in @entity150 and find documents with information on the trekking company the pair were using 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 it was n't until that evening , after emailing the company , that he got a short reply saying that his sister and her husband were safe 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 several strangers who were in the same location as the couple responded to his inquiries on social media , saying they were fine 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 " it was incredible to see people that were stranded themselves over there wanting to help me 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 they had stopped for lunch at @entity192 , just near the border , when the magnitude 7	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
8 quake struck 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 once the tremors eased , @entity184 noticed that his cell phone had died 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 his connection with the outside world had vanished 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 worse , he had a group of older travelers and a short supply of food and water 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 one @entity187 in the group had an international cell phone , but its battery was quickly dying 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 unable to contact anyone in the area , @entity184 made one last attempt , calling his daughter 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 thousands of miles away , in @entity214 , @entity213 picked up that call 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 her father explained the situation : the roads were blocked and there was no way to get back to @entity80 or enter into @entity189 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 the only way to escape was by helicopter 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
 @entity213 learned from the @entity187 embassy that a family had hired a private rescue team , working with the @entity2 army , to rescue the stranded tourists by helicopter , but the team was unable to land because of bad weather 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder

 " all the people in the group are 60 years old or older 	social media has helped people overseas tracked down their loved ones in @placeholder
