 artist , sculptor and former @entity9 firefighter @entity6 will unveil his memorial sunday , the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks , in an @entity0 suburb 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 he recently spoke to @entity1 about his work ; here 's an edited transcript of that interview : @entity1 : tell me a little about how this project started 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 @entity6 : @entity20 , who works with ( the ) @entity21 ( @entity21 ) @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , approached me about doing this memorial 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i guess he saw my work online 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so , he contacted me and told me about his idea to do a memorial outside the fire station using a piece of @entity31 steel 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 from the time we spoke , i kind of had one idea stuck in my head : the phoenix wing , rising out of the ashes 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : where were you on september 11 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : i was somewhere in the middle - end of my firefighter training in the @entity9 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so that day really put a picture of reality on the job i was doing both as a firefighter and as a @entity9 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : how long were you a @entity9 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : i joined the @entity9 around ' 99 and i had my last tour , my second tour of @entity46 , back in 2008 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so , i think around 10 years 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : how did you decide to make the jump to art after your service 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : i 've always done art	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i did it before i went into the military , and now i 'm continuing with it 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i went to ( the @entity54 ) when i transitioned back 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i 've graduated since then , and now i 'm sort of a vagabond in life right now 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 it really gives me a great opportunity to do what i want to do 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and this project is part of it 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : you 've said you enjoy doing memorials 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 why is that 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : i see myself , the artist side of me , as a storyteller 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and i do n't really see art as all that important 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 it 's something i do , it 's something i 've done , it 's always a part of me , and i enjoy it 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 but i 'm not building bridges ; i 'm not saving people 's lives ; i 'm painting pretty pictures 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so the importance to me of art that i can do is to memorialize people who deserve it 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so this is really a chance for me to say these people are important 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 with this memorial specifically , it kind of dawned on me the other day : it 's not just about 9/11 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 it 's not just about that day 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 it 's about the people that lost their lives and that were affected and lost family , friends , but it continues , especially doing this 10 years later , it 's about the people that continue to serve 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 before 9/11 , after 9/11 , they 're still important 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and this memorial sort of brings that to light 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and to me , that 's important 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 to keep people 's minds open 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and that 's kind of what art can do 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : what materials are you working with for this piece 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : it 's steel 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and it 's handmade 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 it 's been myself and my team working at all hours of the night 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 in all temperatures of the ( summer ) heat 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and adding to that temperature , the forges and the heat and the welding and the leather protective gear we 're wearing 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : is there any significance with the number of feathers on your sculpture 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : my uncle called me in the beginning of the build and said 343 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and i said , yeah 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 that 's the number of firefighters that died in 9/11 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 he said 343 feathers 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i kind of looked at my drawings and design 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 i said maybe i could maybe make it happen 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 but the feathers are too big , and there was n't enough room to make it happen 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 but wings in general mean a lot 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and everybody has their own connection to them 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity1 : what will it look like when it 's all finished 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 @entity6 : it will be set on a solid piece of granite that 's in the shape of a pentagon 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 not just to symbolize that building alone but the military and country 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and having that 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 phoenix wing coming out of the ashes with that piece of the trade tower there , that wing can incorporate some of the emotion of the planes that were hijacked 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 and then we 'll have flight markers made out of granite 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 four , one for each flight , with a timeline of all of the events for each flight on each marker 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
 so the whole site is in a 52 - foot circle in front of @entity21 police and fire headquarters 	@entity191 depicts phoenix wing rising from ashes , framing piece of @placeholder steel
