( @entity0 ) a year ago @entity1 published a story with the following headline : @entity4 , a @entity5 , mulls 2016 run for president 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 the story ticked off items on @entity4 's conservative things - to - do list while also noting his close ties to the deep - pocketed @entity5 brothers , as well as other right - wing lobbying groups 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 last august the @entity14 governor was in @entity15 for an @entity17 event ; the group is backed by the conservative @entity5 brothers , and supported gov	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder

 now , @entity4 is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 why would @entity4 ignore the pleas of @entity14 's @entity29 as well as the @entity31 mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was @entity4 's way of shoring up his street cred 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 it is also the reason why @entity31 @entity44 , @entity4 's fellow @entity45 hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend @entity4 and the law 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same - sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
 backlash aside , the fact is @entity4 has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder

 @entity62 , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire @entity31 field farther to the right than the party had hoped 	@entity118 , @entity128 , @entity136 , @entity148 , @entity143 are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for @entity196 has not yet " won " in @placeholder
