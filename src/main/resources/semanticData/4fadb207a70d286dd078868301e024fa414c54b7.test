( @entity1 ) i usually think of april as tax month , but it seems to be morphing into @entity3 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 @entity5 owner @entity4 advised @entity6 to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 following her mother 's cancer diagnosis , singer @entity9 urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 and @entity16 gov	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 @entity15 signed legislation to allow @entity18 to get any lab test without a doctor 's order 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but there are many lab tests to order on yourself : @entity28 's @entity27 lists over a thousand 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 they are not all blood tests , but a lot of them are 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 and since blood tests require blood , you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 @entity4 's advice to get them all : anemia 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 a frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the " test me " market 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 in those states that allow it -- and over half do -- laboratories are offering walk - in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 ( and if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business , check out the franchise opportunities at @entity54 , @entity55 , and all @entity56 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 ) some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but the primary effect wo n't be more health , but rather more medical care 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 fundamentally well people will appear in doctors ' offices with " abnormal " results 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 abnormalities are common in normal people , as we learned when @entity71 - body ct scanning was in vogue a decade ago ( thankfully , only briefly ) 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 so doctors will increasingly face one of two options : take the time to reassure these new patients that their results are n't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 or it will confirm the presence of abnormality -- most of which will be minor abnormalities 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 often it wo n't be clear what to do , but doctors will be pressed to do something 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 that 's when the real problems begin 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 will anybody be helped 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 maybe 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 will anybody be hurt 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 definitely 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 the disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but it 's not that hard for us to make them feel worse 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 decades of research have shown that there are real side - effects to testing the well : more anxiety ( that ca n't be good for your health ) , more procedures ( which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs ) and more treatment for " disease " not destined to cause problems ( as in over a million additional @entity116 men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer ) 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 to see how far wrong testing can go , check out @entity121 : where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 i can tell you one thing for sure , the freedom to test wo n't save money 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 sure , a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but advertising will drive up the volume of testing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 and then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 this will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out - of - pocket costs 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 maybe this kind of freedom of information is n't such a good thing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 of course , there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but if you feel well , do n't think that testing will make you feel better 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 the biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it 's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 now you can sequence your dna , soon you will be able to monitor your immune system 's signature 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch , soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 they are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 a breast cancer monitoring bra -- i ca n't make this stuff up 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 should we outlaw an individual 's freedom to test 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 no	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 we do n't need another victimless crime 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but it is certainly an area that demands regulation 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 the @entity186 has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 it 's also an area that demands education 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 the public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful , that does n't mean they are routinely useful 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 it is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean -- much less what to do about the results 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 @entity208 is a good thing 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 but feel free not to exercise your freedoms 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
 just as carrying a gun does n't necessarily make you any safer , testing yourself does n't necessarily make you any healthier 	@placeholder said people should have their blood tested every quarter
