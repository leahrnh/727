it is one of life 's biggest questions : are we born knowing the difference between good and evil 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 or are we taught our moral beliefs by parents and society 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 philosophers and psychologists have long believed that babies are born " blank slates , " and that it is the role of parents and society to teach babies the difference between right and wrong ; good and bad ; mean and nice 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 but a growing number of researchers now believe differently 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 they believe babies are in fact born with an innate sense of morality , and while parents and society can help develop a belief system in babies , they do n't create one 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 a team of researchers at @entity30 's @entity29 , known as @entity31 , showed us just how they came to that conclusion 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 dr	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 @entity33 runs the @entity31 , and she and her team have been studying the minds and behaviors of babies for decades 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 about eight years ago they began running a series of studies on babies under 24 months to see how much these babies understand about good and bad behavior 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the first test is the simplest 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 show a baby an example of good behavior , and then an example of bad behavior , then let the baby decide what she likes 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 opinion : do babies know right from wrong 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 they begin with a puppet show 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 in this show , a gray cat is seen trying to open a big plastic box 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the cat tries repeatedly , but he just ca n't open the lid all the way 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 a bunny in a green t - shirt comes along and helps open the box 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 then the scenario is repeated , but this time a bunny in an orange t - shirt comes along and slams the box shut before running away 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the green bunny is nice and helpful 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the orange bunny is mean and unhelpful 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the baby is then presented with the two bunnies from the show 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 a staff member who does n't know which bunny was mean and which bunny was nice will offer both bunnies at the same time to the baby 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the baby 's mother , who is usually present during the study , closes her eyes so as not to influence the baby in any way 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 which bunny do the babies choose 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 more than 80 % of the babies in the study showed their preference for the good bunny , either by reaching for the good bunny or staring at it 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 and with 3 - month - olds , that number goes higher , to 87 % 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 so what does this tell us 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 @entity94 , author of " @entity95 : the @entity102 " and a professor of psychology at @entity30 , says these studies show that even before babies can speak or walk , they judge good and bad in the actions of others because they are born with a rudimentary sense of justice 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 but @entity94 , who is married to @entity105 , says this sense of justice is " tragically limited 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 " although babies are born with an innate sense of morality , they are also born with flaws 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 what 's your baby really thinking 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 he writes : " we are by nature indifferent , even hostile to strangers ; we are prone towards parochialism and bigotry 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 some of our instinctive emotional responses , most notably disgust , spur us to do terrible things , including acts of genocide 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 " and the role of parents and society is to overcome these limitations and further develop the innate moral beliefs that already exist in those baby minds 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 skeptics of the studies say babies are not capable of making intelligent choices , and perhaps babies are drawn to a certain color , or they choose according to where the puppets are placed 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the team at the @entity31 has been very careful in their studies to change the puppets , shirt colors and placement of the animals before presenting them to various babies , and they feel confident their published research is sound 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the @entity31 has developed a series of studies based on the simple premise that babies have this simple understanding of good and bad 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
 the other studies explore reward and punishment , compromise and the roots of bias 	@placeholder researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong
