( @entity0 ) -- while most first - time visitors to @entity2 choo - choose to travel by train , consider the convenience of driving 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 behind the wheel you 're totally free , going where you want , when you want 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 when drivers come off a ferry in @entity11 or @entity12 , they usually see a sign warning them to drive on the left 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 driving in the @entity15 is wonderful -- once you remember to stay on the left and after you 've mastered the roundabouts 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 but be warned : every year i get some emails from traveling readers advising me that , for them , trying to drive in @entity11 and @entity12 was a nerve - wracking and regrettable mistake 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 here 's a tip : if you want to get a little slack on the roads , drop by a gas station or auto shop and buy a green " p " ( probationary driver with license ) sign to put in your car window 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 of course , in @entity11 and @entity12 you 'll be driving on the left - hand side of the road 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 why that side 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 originally , it was in order for you to drive defensively 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 with your " sword hand " on the inside to protect you against oncoming traffic 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 many @entity43 drivers find the hardest part is n't driving on the left , but steering from the right 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 your instinct is to put yourself on the left side of your lane , which means you may spend your first day or two constantly drifting off the road to the left 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 it can help to remember that the driver always stays close to the center line 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 not only will you be driving on the left , but you 'll also be using roundabouts , where traffic continually flows in a circle around a center island 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 these work well if you follow the golden rule : traffic in roundabouts always has the right - of - way , while entering vehicles yield 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 for some drivers , roundabouts are high - pressure traffic circles that require a snap decision about something you do n't completely understand : your exit 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 to replace the stress with giggles , make it standard operating procedure to take a 360 - degree , case - out - your - options exploratory circuit 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 discuss the exits with your navigator , go around again if necessary , and then confidently wing off on the exit of your choice 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 whenever possible , avoid driving in cities 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 @entity84 even assesses a congestion charge -- about $ 13 per day -- to drive in the city center ( see www	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations

 it 's best and less stressful to begin your driving experience away from big cities , so try renting your car in a smaller town 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 a pleasant scenario for a @entity11 itinerary would be to start your trip in a small town such as @entity96 , rent a car when leaving @entity96 , explore @entity11 at your leisure by car , then drop off the car in @entity101 , and take the train into @entity84 , where you can rely on the excellent public transportation system 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 outside of the big cities and the motorways ( freeways ) , @entity15 and @entity106 roads tend to be narrow 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 adjust your perceptions of personal space 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 it 's not " my side of the road " or " your side of the road 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 " it 's just " the road " -- and it 's shared as a cooperative adventure 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 in towns , you may have to cross over the center line just to get past parked cars 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 sometimes both directions of traffic can pass parked cars simultaneously , but frequently you 'll have to take turns -- follow the locals ' lead and drive defensively 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 on rural roads , locals are usually courteous , pulling over against a hedgerow and blinking their headlights for you to pass while they wait 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 return the favor when you are closer to a wide spot in the road than they are 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 do some homework before getting behind the wheel ; buy good maps and check various mapping web sites , including @entity141 's site and @entity142 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 a gps device can also be helpful 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 you 'll notice some differences between driving in the @entity106 versus the @entity146 ( @entity11 and @entity12 ) 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 in the @entity106 , the speed limit is in kilometers per hour , road signs are usually bilingual ( but not always -- " geill sli " means yield ) , and roads are more likely to be bumpy and poorly maintained 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 in the @entity146 , the speed limit is in miles per hour , signs are in @entity153 ( except in @entity154 , where they are bilingual ) , and roads are generally in better condition 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 even if you do n't drive , as a pedestrian you 'll have to remember that among our @entity15 and @entity106 cousins ' many unusual habits , traffic comes from the opposite direction -- look both ways before crossing any street 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 horror stories about @entity15 and @entity106 traffic abound 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 they 're fun to tell , but driving here is really only a problem for those who make it one 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 the most dangerous creature on the road is the panicked @entity174 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
 drive defensively , observe , fit in , avoid big - city driving when you can and wear your seat belt 	his tv series , " @placeholder , " airs on @entity195 stations
