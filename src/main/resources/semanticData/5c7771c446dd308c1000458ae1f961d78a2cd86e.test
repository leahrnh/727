( @entity2 ) @entity1 's cybercensors have long used a " @entity9 " to block its citizens from reading critical articles from @entity6 news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 but it 's no longer enough for them , says a study published friday 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 they 've developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders , including in the @entity17 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the study 's authors have named it the " @entity22 , " and it operates in plain sight 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 going on the attack so visibly and handily within another country 's borders will probably draw international ire , the study 's authors say , and @entity29 may have counted on that 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " this is a powerful attack capability , and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the @entity1 government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack , " said researcher @entity31 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the reason @entity1 censors are taking that risk : free - speech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the @entity9 and give @entity1 readers greater access to the @entity45 's free press 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders

 the @entity53 wrecked two online services with @entity56 attacks in march , say the researchers from the @entity59 's @entity58 , the @entity60 , the @entity61 and @entity62 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 many of the researchers focus on the abuse of information technology to undermine civil liberties and human rights 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 and they are afraid this new cyberweapon could easily be used for an array of powerful attacks beyond what they 've already observed 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " a modest technical change could turn the @entity22 into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a @entity1 server , " @entity31 said 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 this might include all emails headed in and out of @entity1 , he said 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " the device could replace genuine attachments with malicious files , for example 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " one of the @entity22 's targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one -- @entity89 , run by @entity1 expats bent on fighting @entity29 's censorship 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 they monitor @entity1 citizens ' access to international news sites such as @entity97 news service @entity96 or the @entity98 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 but the other target may seem odd at first glance 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 @entity101 is a popular @entity103 hosting service used by programmers who want to share code with each other 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the two attacks were connected , however , the study says 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 @entity109 hosted two @entity101 repositories that contained computer code allowing @entity1 readers to get around the @entity9 and read the @entity113 in @entity1 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 critical articles from the @entity113 are a particular fly in the ointment for @entity29 , and @entity1 has turned away at least three of the paper 's reporters in short succession , according to a @entity17 congressional commission on @entity1 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 @entity101 said it thought the attackers were trying to coerce it into taking content offline 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 @entity109 says it suspects the attack may have been in response to a @entity128 article on its struggle to circumvent @entity1 censors 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 both services suspected @entity1 was behind their attacks and used the @entity9 to carry it out , according to statements and media reports 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 by triggering attacks and analyzing them , the researchers concluded that @entity29 has developed a tool distinctly different from the @entity9 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 they are confident it is also in @entity1 and say it is technically similar to the @entity9 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the firewall , in a manner of speaking , stands aside and watches all digital traffic going in and out of @entity1 , the researchers say 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 if it sees requests going out into the world for content it does n't want citizens to see , the researchers say , it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the @entity1 user 's computer to make them stop communicating 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the user might see an @entity154 reply -- " sorry , you 're not authorized to see this page 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " not only does the @entity9 monitor tons of traffic , but its systems have to do a lot of processing to discern what to block and what not , so it 's work - intensive 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 the @entity22 takes on a much lighter load , because it does n't care about all that traffic 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 instead , it targets traffic between a handful of web addresses 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 but it uses web traffic unrelated to its targets to build its attack against them 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 users going to @entity177 , one of @entity1 's most prolific web services and most successful @entity181 companies , can become unknowing proxy warriors against the @entity22 's targets , the study says 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 in the overwhelming number of cases , when traffic came into @entity1 from the outside world , the @entity22 let it through to @entity177 's advertising servers 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 but in a tiny fraction of the cases the researchers observed , it picked out computers it wanted to use in the attack , and sent bad code back to the user 's browser 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
 " the malicious script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting participant in the @entity56 attack against @entity109 and @entity101 , " the authors wrote 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders

 " @entity101 said the march incident was the biggest @entity56 attack in its history 	@placeholder 's cybercensors have developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders
