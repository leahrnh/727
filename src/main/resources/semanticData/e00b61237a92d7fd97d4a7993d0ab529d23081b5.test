 given that @entity4 security forces still need time to ramp up and @entity4 politicians need space to form to form a more inclusive government to whittle @entity3 support for @entity23 , " this is going to be a long - term project , " @entity10 said from the @entity46 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says

 " dozens , including 60 children , according to @entity110 have died on the mountain where the @entity8 are battling extreme temperatures and a lack of food and water 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says

 @entity1 aircraft are poised to strike @entity23 militants who have surrounded the mountain , @entity10 said 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says

 " my team has been vigilant 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says
 about foreign fighters and jihadists gathering in @entity156 and now @entity4 , who might potentially launch attacks outside of the region against @entity160 targets and @entity1 targets , " he said 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says

 @entity197 , a @entity198 analyst with the conservative @entity199 , cautioned saturday that even if @entity187 's government would have been more inclusive , @entity23 still would have been a problem 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says
 " no matter how magnanimous @entity187 could have been in an ideal world , it would have meant nothing to @entity23 , many of whose members are n't even @entity4 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says
 sometimes there 's no magic diplomatic formula , " @entity197 , a @entity78 official under former president @entity206 , told @entity83 	@placeholder cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food , the military says
