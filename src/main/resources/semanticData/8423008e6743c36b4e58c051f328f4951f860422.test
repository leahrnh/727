( @entity2 ) on october 31 , 2014 , the @entity1 government announced the end of " @entity4 " -- a naval mission that rescued would - be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the @entity8 to seek security and a new life in @entity11 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 in the operation 's year - long existence , the @entity12 and @entity13 had rescued an estimated 100,000 people 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 but it proved expensive and politically contentious , and @entity11 was not prepared to help @entity1 shoulder the burden of the crisis 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 without @entity11 support , the @entity1 government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity4 , which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013 , was replaced by the more modest " @entity25 , " under the auspices of the @entity28 's border agency , @entity29 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity25 has about one - third of the funding of @entity4 , with just six ships and patrol boats , two planes and one helicopter 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 it was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 at its inception , @entity37 , operations director for @entity29 , said " @entity25 is not a replacement for @entity4 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " nor was @entity29 " a coordinating body for search and rescue operations 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " six months later , the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for @entity11 continues unabated 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 contributors to @entity25 include @entity47 , the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity52 -- for example -- is not 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 it argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are " an unintended ' pull factor , ' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " it 's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot - button issue in @entity52 , with the @entity52 @entity63 attacking the conservative - led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 similarly , the opposition @entity67 in @entity1 opposed @entity4 , accusing it of enticing migrants 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 if the first few months of this year are any guide , demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 people from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression , violence and abject poverty 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 despite the danger , the great majority head first for @entity80 , where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity1 -- the @entity11 state whose territory is closest to @entity80 -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up , sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 in 2014 , 170,000 migrants arrived in @entity1 by sea 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity1 ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 the islands of @entity97 and of @entity98 ( which is closer to @entity99 than to mainland @entity1 ) see an almost daily influx of human misery 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 and at this time of year , there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity1 prime minister @entity107 has said the @entity8 is a sea , not a cemetery 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 on sunday , in the wake of the latest disaster , he complained that @entity1 had been coping with the crisis in " near solitude , sometimes assisted by some other international presence 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " @entity1 has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in @entity80 , not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants , many of whom set out from around @entity122 and other ports in the west of the country 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 according to some human rights groups , the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress -- despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 after the latest sinking , the @entity138 called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers , saying that " the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 these are human lives at stake , and the @entity28 as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " @entity28 foreign policy chief @entity148 , who is @entity1 , said sunday : " we need to save human lives all together , as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " the task could not be " left only to the southern countries , " she insisted 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 but bold action is rarely a hallmark of the @entity28 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 the recently installed head of the @entity138 , @entity159 , has set out his priorities -- but they are yet to be acted upon 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity159 said the current budget of @entity29 - some 90 million euros ( $ 97 million ) - was " a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting @entity11 's common borders 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " that money has to cover all @entity29 's roles -- and it 's not only the @entity1 coast that is being targeted by migrants 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 further east , thousands of migrants are trying to reach @entity170 by land and sea 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 according to the @entity176 's refugee agency , 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the @entity8 last year 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 @entity159 has also argued for greater assistance to the @entity178 , which is based in @entity179 , arguing for " more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " most controversially , @entity159 is proposing @entity11 adopt a common asylum system , saying that " one and the same applicant for asylum can have a 70 - 75 % chance of being granted asylum in one country of the @entity28 and less than 1 % , with the same reasons , in another country 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " but progress toward a @entity11 - wide approach on migration is painfully slow 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 the @entity138 plans to publish a policy document next month , but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 in the meantime , the argument in @entity11 meetings is likely to focus on priorities , with some ( the @entity52 and @entity202 ) likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people - smuggling racket 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 " we must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys , " said @entity52 foreign secretary @entity205 sunday 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 others , including @entity1 , @entity170 , @entity213 and @entity214 , are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
 but the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from @entity80 beaches will be oblivious to the debate 	@entity12 's " @placeholder " mission to rescue would - be migrants in peril rescued an estimated 100,000 people
