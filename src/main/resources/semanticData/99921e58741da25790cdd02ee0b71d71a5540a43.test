@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the little - known star of this week 's no	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 1 car chase movie , " @entity5 " is n't a car 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 it 's an airplane 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 film producers hired a @entity10 c - 130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free - fall stunt 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity17 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 happy 60th birthday to the @entity19 -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity10 has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b - 52 bomber and the famous @entity26 spy jet 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 unlike those planes , the @entity27 has never become a household name 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the fact that " @entity32 " producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the @entity19 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the film makes it appear as if another plane -- a @entity38 -- drops the cars 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 but in real life , it took a @entity19 to pull it off 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges , said stunt coordinator @entity44 in a featurette video about the mission 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " you start throwing all those cars out together -- you 've got to figure out spacing 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 and these things drop very fast , " @entity49 said 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity51 of @entity52 co-piloted the stunt 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " we have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes , " he says in the video 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the @entity19 is big 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 it 's tough 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 it 's versatile 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 it refuels helicopters in flight 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 it can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short , unfinished airstrips 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 at @entity10 's @entity0 , @entity1 , factory in 1955 , the governor of @entity1 christened the first production @entity69 by smashing a bottle of @entity72 water across its nose 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the plane then proceeded to take off from nearby @entity75 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 on tuesday , exactly 60 years later , @entity1 gov	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity76 recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new @entity19 during a birthday party of sorts for @entity10 executives and military dignitaries 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " i 'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the ( assembly ) line inside this building , " @entity76 said 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " it transports , it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " inside the plane 's cockpit , @entity10 test pilot @entity91 said he 's done a lot of air - drop testing while flying c - 130s 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " we 've dropped some crazy things out , " @entity91 said 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " @entity99 dropping a car out of an airplane is easy 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 whatever we can fit inside the ( cargo ) hold , we can drop 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop , @entity91 said , including payload weight , wind speed and timing 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " we have to give time for the car to clear the airplane , let the parachutes deploy , and then actually open , " he said 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 one tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " there 's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " @entity91 also explained how the @entity27 's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " the pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdown 's going to be , " he said 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " sometimes to get his performance , he needs to really let it crunch on the ground 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 but the airplane can handle it 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " meanwhile , in the back of the plane , @entity10 loadmaster @entity135 showed off the plane 's new reversible deck , which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 to a floor with rollers embedded in it 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the legacy surrounding the @entity19 has been built by 60 years of successful missions , including : in 1989 , a flight crew aboard a @entity19 named @entity154 was credited with saving the crew of a @entity157 hurricane hunter airplane 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 while flying through @entity159 , the @entity157 plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity163 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the @entity157 plane to escape the eye of the deadly category 5 storm 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 everyone returned safely to base 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 in 2012 , @entity170 brig 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 gen	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity171 revealed how he flew a @entity19 on a successful hostage rescue mission to @entity173 , @entity174 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 four c - 130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked @entity178 flight in 1976 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " at some places that were particularly dangerous , we flew at an altitude of 35 feet , " to evade radar 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " trust me , this is scary 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " he told idfblog	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
com 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 during the military build up to 2003 's @entity187 - led invasion of @entity188 , a @entity19 test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the @entity191 's arsenal -- a so - called @entity192 -- known in military circles as " the mother of all bombs 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 " a @entity27 ejected the 21,000 - pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above @entity199 's @entity198 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 in the past , the @entity202 attached small solid - fuel rocket engines to some c - 130s 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the @entity19 was n't designed to land on aircraft carriers 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 they 're too short 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 nonetheless , a @entity19 did it -- during a test in 1963 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 that 's how amazing this plane is 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 but nothing lasts forever , and the @entity27 is no different 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the @entity202 has been developing a so - called " super short takeoff and landing aircraft " that might replace the @entity19 after 2020 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the @entity216 calls it @entity217 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 the proposed four - engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short , improvised airfields 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
 @entity191 planners apparently are hoping to create a @entity19 - inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century 	@entity233 in @placeholder celebrates the flight of the first c - 130 production model
