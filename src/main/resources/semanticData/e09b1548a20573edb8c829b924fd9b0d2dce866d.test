( @entity0 ) -- one of the questions i 've been asked the most in the 10 days since judge @entity4 's summary was published of @entity6 's report into the conduct of the @entity9 bids , is the extent to which i 'm upset with the comments about me as the " @entity13 whistleblower 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 " the answer is : not that much -- and there are two reasons 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 first , the report is an investigation into @entity19 of the world governing body 's decisions and processes , conducted by @entity6 who is paid by @entity19 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 the conclusions reached are that there 's really nothing to worry about when it comes to @entity19 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 surprise 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 do you see the pattern here 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 second , while it was n't nice to read what was written about me and it was n't what i expected , it is also untrue 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 i did n't expect to read about any of the 75 individuals with whom @entity6 met , let alone to see @entity36 and me singled out in such negative terms 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 not only were the two of us referred to as " whistle - blowers " in the pejorative , but i was referred to as " unreliable " and @entity36 -- who worked on the successful @entity42 bid -- was referred to as both " not credible " and " unreliable 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 " it was an extraordinary and unprofessional attack by one or both of the two men who preside over @entity19 's @entity46 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 while @entity4 or @entity6 must have their reasons for so openly flouting standards of whistle - blower conventions , the important point is they also accepted the issues that i raised with them 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 the issues that are subsequently presented in the summary report related to @entity13 -- and which @entity4 refers to as " potentially problematic conduct " -- are amongst the matters i discussed with @entity6 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 for me , this is the key point as the real issue is @entity19 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 in any case , as @entity6 himself has claimed , it is also easy to find errors in the summary report 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 for example , in the section related to the former @entity67 member , @entity66 , it is noted that @entity70 's ( @entity70 ) intention to support @entity13 's bid " was publicly reported as early as october 17 , 2010 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 " wrong 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 it was announced by the president of @entity13 's football association at a media conference , alongside president @entity76 , in @entity77 on june 1 , 2008 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 this is a matter of public record 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 it is curious that either @entity6 or @entity4 got this date wrong by 28 months because it goes to the heart of issues raised earlier in the summary report , and it is also relevant to what appears to be an illogical conclusion regarding the impact of @entity89 's eventual absence from taking part in the final vote 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 but while the focus of the past four years has been the decisions of the @entity67 regarding 2018/2022 , @entity19 has been the subject of corruption allegations for decades 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 concerned about his legacy after the 2018/2022 decisions , @entity76 embarked upon successive so - called governance reforms in 2011 that left most people shaking their heads in disbelief 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 first , he announced the establishment of a " @entity104 " comprising @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 when it finally dawned on @entity76 that this was n't his brightest idea , he invited @entity111 and an independent @entity113 governance expert , professor @entity114 to advise him 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 @entity111 later quit , raising questions over @entity19 's commitment to reform because @entity114 was being paid by the world governing body 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 professor @entity114 hung in there for more than two years but could not chip - away at the cultural change required in the organization 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 a high - profile anti-bribery expert who was a member of one of the new committees , @entity128 , quit in 2013 telling the @entity129 : " we all focus our efforts where we can have an impact and i was not having an impact at @entity19 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 " it is important the organization you are dealing with is receptive to those efforts and receptive to change 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 " the independent governance committee put in a tremendous amount of work and effort putting together some fairly uncontroversial recommendations which were then knocked back , " said @entity138 , who is president of the non-profit international anti-bribery group @entity139 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 @entity19 has grown to become an international commercial behemoth -- albeit an unaccountable one -- in @entity76 's time and he has built the @entity9 into one of the most prestigious sporting event on the planet 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 but it has been at the expense of the reputation of world football and without regard for the two key stakeholders of the game -- players and fans 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 @entity19 is incapable of reforming itself -- and it is time for those of us who love the game and who play the game to ask sponsors , broadcasters and governments to intervene to give us a new world governing body now 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 what football should have is an international governing body that has the same level of transparency and accountability that we expect of our governments , major institutions and international organizations 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 an international governing body that is responsible to the many millions of people who play the game and the billions who are fans ; and one that meets standards befitting an organization that will make a profit of $ 2 billion from the @entity184 , according to @entity185 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 governments , sponsors and broadcasters should demand an interim time limited administration , led by an eminent person with a broad mandate to develop a new constitution , governance arrangements and policies and to conduct new elections -- in other words , an @entity198 - like reform 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 together with @entity200 i 've been invited by @entity202 mp @entity201 to help arrange a @entity19 reform conference in @entity204 in january , which i hope will produce the reforms that the @entity198 put into place 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 finally , another question i have been asked is whether i would do this again 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 being a whistle - blower means your life changes 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 in my case , i raised my concerns internally but my employment was terminated 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 it takes a toll financially and emotionally 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 in a relatively small country like @entity13 , you lose your livelihood ; and , at my stage in life , the financial security you were building for your family 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 but we all need to consider how we want our lives measured 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 we all make choices 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
 in the case of @entity19 , you can play in the sandpit ; you can leave your principles at the door ; or you can be prepared to be resilient and take the consequences from those who desperately want to maintain the sinecures of the status quo 	@entity237 points to errors in recent @placeholder report
