editor 's note : @entity2 is president of @entity3 : the @entity4 , a nonprofit institute that researches attitudes toward extremism 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 @entity7 is deputy director of the @entity8 at the @entity9 , a think tank that promotes ideas across the ideological spectrum 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 @entity12 says whoever won the election , @entity15 strongly favor free elections and a free press 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 ( @entity18 ) -- in a poll conducted three weeks before @entity15 's june 12 vote , our nonprofit organizations found a consensus among @entity15 , including almost all of those who told us they would vote for president @entity26 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 and that consensus is that @entity15 want a truly democratic system 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 given @entity15 ' own priorities for their government , the events of the past few days may ultimately weaken president @entity26 's standing -- even among those who did vote to re-elect him 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 in fact , our survey found that more than 86 percent of @entity15 who said they would vote for @entity26 also chose ensuring free elections and a free press as among the most important priorities they have for the @entity15 government 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 the recent events -- the early announcements of election returns , the shutting down of communications networks , the massive protests and now the bloodshed -- have the potential to change what was once an electoral contest into a broader struggle for the soul of the @entity51 and the future of @entity15 itself 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 let us be clear : our polling indicates that the government 's actions run counter to the priorities of almost all @entity15 , including its own supporters 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 and our survey shows beyond dispute that @entity15 of all political persuasions want more democratic freedoms , not less 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 our op - ed published on monday has drawn much attention -- and misunderstanding 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 our nonprofit organizations conducted the only independent and transparent nationwide public opinion survey in @entity15 before the june 12 vote 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 the poll found that @entity26 was leading his nearest opponent , the more reform - minded candidate @entity69 , by a more than 2 - to - 1 margin , with almost a third undecided 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 our poll concluded three weeks before the election 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 it does not predict the final vote , nor does it measure a possible surge for @entity69 , which many believe occurred in the final weeks 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 instead , as we wrote on monday , our survey indicates " the possibility that the vote is not the product of widespread fraud " because of @entity26 's formidable early lead 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 this single finding , however , has obscured our most important findings , and their significance to what is now enfolding in @entity15 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 nearly 80 percent want the right to vote for all their leaders , including the all - powerful supreme leader , while nearly 90 percent chose free elections and a free press as the most important goals they have for their government -- virtually tied with the top priority of improving the @entity15 economy 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 and here is the most important fact of all : more than 86 percent of those who told us they support @entity26 also choose free elections and a free press as their most important priorities for their leaders 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 in other words , in our survey , @entity26 supporters back real democratic reforms in @entity15 as much as supporters of the more avowedly reform candidate @entity69 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 put all together , our polling shows that @entity26 , running a competent campaign , may have had enough support three weeks before the vote to possibly win the election under the electoral rules as they stood 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 with @entity26 's early lead , it is possible that the vote reported did actually reflect the will of the @entity15 people , though now , it is impossible to know 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 analysts pore over " ambiguous " election results yet the government 's actions since the election may have changed the debate in @entity15 from being about candidates to being about democracy 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 while we do not know whether the election results were rigged , the government 's handling of the election itself runs counter to principles of democracy , free press and free elections -- goals our polling shows almost all @entity15 , whether or not they support @entity26 , strongly support 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 @entity69 appears to understand this 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 yesterday in a massive rally in @entity143 , @entity69 stated as much , saying " the vote of the people is more important than @entity69 or any other person 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 " meanwhile , the subsequent killing of protesters by government security forces will likely only work against @entity26 and by extension now , the supreme leader , even among more than 86 percent of their supporters 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 while our poll showed @entity26 with an early commanding lead , by the government 's post-election response , the irony is that @entity26 may indeed end up stealing the election -- from himself 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity7 	they say their poll ca n't determine whether @placeholder had a late surge
