@entity0 ( @entity1 ) a second robotic probe sent into the crippled @entity4 nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity7 ( @entity7 ) deployed the second remote - controlled robot last week after the first one broke down 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 the robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected , an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively , according to a statement released by @entity7 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 " it is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation , " said @entity16 , the chief of @entity18 plant 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity7 said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating , though the cause was unknown 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 it said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 the shape - shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity7 says the site 's still too dangerous for workers to enter 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 the first robot , which was sent in on april 10 , stalled after moving about 10 meters , according to a statement released by @entity7 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 a report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity7 decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on april 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations , completing around two - thirds of the originally planned route 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 the second robot was sent in on april 15 and collected data from all 11 points , as scheduled 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 four years after the devastating nuclear crisis , the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 decommissioning work is estimated to cost $ 50 billion and will take years to complete 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity7 called the robotic probe an " unprecedented " experiment 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
 @entity1 's @entity64 and @entity65 reported from @entity0 , @entity66 and @entity67 wrote from @entity68 	a robotic probe into the @placeholder nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor
