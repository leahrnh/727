@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- i wish i were surprised that @entity5 gov	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity4 does n't see a problem with concealed weapons in schools , but after watching his failed bid for the presidency , the truth is there 's very little that man can say that will truly surprise me 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " if you have been duly back - grounded and trained and you are a concealed handgun license - carrying individual , you should be able to carry your handgun anywhere in this state , " @entity4 said at a tea party event held on monday 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 it seems his line of reasoning is in line with some of his gun - loving brethren who believe if teachers and principals are armed , tragedies like the one in @entity22 would go away 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 it 's as if he thinks " @entity35 " is a documentary 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 in a country with fewer than 350 million people but more than 310 million guns , we do n't need more of them 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 we need fewer 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 and when it comes to our schools , we do n't need guns at all 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 so it 's very fortunate that @entity1 gov	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity45 had the good sense to veto @entity47 59 on tuesday 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 the proposed law would have allowed people with permits to carry concealed weapons and with extra training , to bring their guns to traditional " gun - free " zones such as day care centers and schools 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 and by " extra training , " the bill called for an additional eight hours and another 94 rounds on the firing range 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 that 's it 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 it was approved the day before the shootings in @entity22 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 on monday -- while @entity4 was encouraging guns in schools -- a letter signed by all 21 superintendents in my county was sent to gov	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity45 asking him to veto the bill because , unlike the gun - happy politicians who rammed the legislation through in a lame duck session , educators do not believe guns in schools are a good thing 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 i have yet to hear a teacher who has survived a massacre advocate for guns in schools 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 in fact , the @entity83 -- with its 1	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
5 million members -- also sent a letter to @entity45 opposing the bill , saying , " we should be doing everything we can to reduce the possibility of any gunfire in schools and concentrate on ways to keep all guns off school property 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " in moments of stress , typically the first thing to erode is our motor skills 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 so the argument that educators should be ready to dodge gunfire , avoid hitting students and take out a gunman so someone hundreds of miles away can buy military - grade weapons and ammunition for kicks is a very stupid argument to make 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 and yet , we heard elements of that reasoning soon after the movie theater killings in @entity113 , @entity114 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity5 rep	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity115 asked : " it does make me wonder , with all those people in the theater , was there nobody that was carrying a gun that could have stopped this guy more quickly 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " yes , @entity115 -- because what a dark room filled with tear gas and panicked people needs is more guns 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 that makes as much sense as the lawmakers in @entity132 allowing concealed weapons in the state @entity134 in @entity136 -- and then needing to install alert buttons on the phones of every senator and staffer in case someone came in and started shooting up the place with one of those concealed weapons 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 gov	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 @entity45 needed to veto @entity147 59 , not because the mood of the country has shifted because of the @entity22 tragedy , but because it was bad legislation to begin with 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 we do n't need -- and most educators do n't want -- guns in schools 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 i said most because @entity158 , superintendent of the @entity160 school district in @entity5 , where employees have been allowed to carry guns in schools since 2008 , told the @entity164 : " nothing is 100 % 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 but what we do know is that we 've done all we can to protect our children 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " also , on " @entity170 , " former secretary of education @entity168 said , " i 'm not so sure i would n't want one person in a school armed , ready for this kind of thing 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 it has to be someone who 's trained , responsible 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 but , my @entity179 , if you can prevent this kind of thing , i think you ought to 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " @entity168 : the case for gun rights is stronger than you think let 's think about this : in august , nine bystanders in @entity185 were wounded as a result of police gunfire -- the police were trying to arrest a suspect connected with another shooting 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 in september , police in @entity192 shot and killed a double amputee in a wheelchair who was trying to stab an officer -- with a pen 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 back in 2009 , in @entity4 's state of @entity5 , a military doctor opened fire at the @entity202 post , killing 13 and wounding 30 others 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 the victims were all professionals , surrounded by guns , and trained to handle -- in @entity168 's words -- " this kind of thing 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 " why would anyone think teachers and principals could take a couple of weekend classes and do better than them 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 it just does n't make sense 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 having police patrol the area during school hours is fine 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 but allowing guns in school is simply counterintuitive to the kind of civilized society we want to live in and represent to the rest of the world 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 did you know , in addition to schools and day care centers , @entity230 would 've allowed guns in hospitals , stadiums and churches 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 i 'm not anti-gun -- i have one in my house 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 but i ask you : what kind of people feel the need to have a gun with them in church 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 i 'll tell you what kind : the kind who probably should n't have one in the first place 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
 the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 	@entity251 : @entity5 governor @placeholder among those ok with concealed weapons in schools
