 i had learned the word " acquittal " just that day 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 it meant they would n't be held responsible 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 community leaders were gathered at the front , speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the trial had been covered extensively , and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to @entity13 's head and body -- could be justified or excused 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 there was shouting and cursing 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder

 @entity60 were police action , or , more specifically , perceived unjust police action 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder

 and the same in @entity73 in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist @entity77 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the @entity73 riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder

 my parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement , and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 it was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger , discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 juxtapose decades - old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in @entity106 and @entity107 with tuesday 's images of @entity41 youths throwing rocks at police , and you wonder what has happened 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 as a 12 - year - old girl in @entity7 , i did n't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods , and risk going to jail , by rioting 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i was afraid because i did n't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the @entity127 - @entity127 community , causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 but two months ago , i agreed to moderate a panel at the @entity131 called " riot -- @entity133 of the @entity134 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " the occasion was to mark the @entity137 premiere of " @entity57 ' 67 , " a play written by @entity139 and directed by @entity140 that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the @entity57 ' 67 riot , including the joy and love they found with one another 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the play and the panel were programmed by @entity151 , a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in @entity127 society 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 inspired by the mission , i had recently joined the board 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 although pegged to the past , the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against @entity127 men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence , or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized , both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 i learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda , often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community , church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 this is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 at the conclusion of the 1967 @entity57 riot , president @entity196 condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that : " this is not a time for angry reaction 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 it is a time for action , starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " his administration convened the @entity218 to examine the 1965 - 68 riots , and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness , poverty , a lack of political power , unfair housing , police brutality and inferior schools 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 after the beating of @entity77 in @entity73 , the @entity229 was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force , unjust treatment in the criminal justice system , poor housing , and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 after all of these riots , the affected city , state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 maybe the @entity41 youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in @entity51 in 1965 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 as recounted in " @entity252 " by @entity253 , dr	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 @entity60 went to @entity51 to try to calm tensions , and a hostile youth said to him : " we won 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " @entity60 challenged him : " how have you won 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 homes are destroyed , blacks are dead in the streets , stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " the young man replied , " we won because we made the whole world pay attention 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the police chief and mayor had never been here 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 we made them come 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " dr	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 @entity60 would say near the end of his life : " it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 it would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without , at the same time , condemning the contingent , intolerable conditions that exist in our society 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 these conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 and i must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 " when i learned that @entity41 high school students planned a purge based on the movie " @entity293 , " in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes , it suddenly made sense 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 they thought they would n't be held responsible for their crimes 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 they thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word " acquitted " i learned the day of the @entity7 riots 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 but they got it wrong 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 they will forever live the repercussions of their actions , regardless of the impetus 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 but the rev	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 @entity311 got it right when he said he would open his @entity313 in @entity41 to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 that power was evident after the shooting of @entity321 in @entity322 , @entity323 , and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 those protests were mostly peaceful 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 and the government responded -- not out of fear of violence , but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 after several months of investigation , the far - reaching @entity335 report on @entity322 issued in march concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue , combined with a systemic racial bias , had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and @entity344 , 14th , @entity346 and first amendment rights violations against african - americans in @entity322 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the report made recommendations that the @entity349 , as well as other departments across the country , should enact to improve police relations in communities of color 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
 the riots in @entity41 have rightfully been quashed , but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard 	@entity359 : the anger and frustration i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @placeholder
