@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- dark shadows were lifting themselves off the sidewalk , slowly stretching , shaking the slumber from their limbs 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 it was 6:15 a	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
m	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 in @entity0 's capital , @entity8 , and i was setting off on a 12 - hour drive , leaving its lush boulevards for @entity12 , the sands of the @entity14 , the desert trails to @entity16 , and the chaos @entity20 's war there is causing 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the sun had yet to raise itself over the roofs but already the first hints of day were breaking the sleep of the destitute at the roadside 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 i have seen poverty before , but even shrouded in the predawn gray , there is no mistaking it : people with little of anything save a public place to lay their heads 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 despite tough lives , the people here are warm , welcoming and hospitable 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 " bonjour , " they say , hinting at their recent @entity39 colonial past 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 it seems to have overlaid , in part at least , their far earlier conversion to @entity44 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 " as - @entity47 , " the @entity46 greeting , is rarely used 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 long @entity39 loaves -- not @entity46 flatbread -- are on sale at tiny stalls 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we 've already passed through the checkpoint on the outskirts of the capital before the countryside begins to take shape 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 gendarmes in what look like fading @entity39 military fatigues checked the car 's documents and a man in orange overalls took a few dollars ' road toll for the 950 kilometers , or 600 miles , we will drive 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the rope blocking our way across the road was dropped and we were released onto a strangely empty highway 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 slowly the countryside began to show is colors 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 @entity72 shaded to blue , to a dark olive green 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 then in an instant the sun smothers everything , washing away the stains of the night 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 our journey lurches into gear , no longer feeling like we 're sluggishly passing anonymous vegetation 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 our momentum , at least in our minds , increases as we streak past the newly revealed rich green towering maize , the thickly leaved luxuriant trees 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 this land is green and fertile 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 everything is vibrant in a way @entity89 could truly appreciate 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 in the villages , strange , bulging , round mud buildings - like an oversize , slightly squashed rugby ball - mingle with mud and straw shacks 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 they have no door , only a scant straw roof : grain stores hinting at the bounty of the land 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 village after village , we pass them 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the more there are , the bigger they are , the more grain is held and the more prosperous the people who own them 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 lest this give an illusion of wealth , consider this : most children we see are barefoot , and that 's almost half @entity0 's people 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 within a few hours of leaving the capital , none of the villages have electricity , running water , sanitation , a building that 's not made out of mud and straw 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the slightly larger towns have slightly more 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 but that 's all 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the farther we go , the villages become fewer and farther between 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the muddy ponds , courtesy of the recent rains , shrink , and the striking longhorn cattle and goats jostle for a place to slake their thirst 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the tarmac on the highway begins to break apart 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we slam into potholes , lurching , juddering forward 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the bright greens are gone , the vegetation paler and browner here 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the great trees have shrunk to tiny shrubs 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we are still 200 miles from @entity12 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 grass covers some of the land , the grain huts are long gone , and quickly so is the road 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we are no longer dodging potholes , we are driving in one big long one 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the cell phone service that has surprisingly kept us company so much of the journey has also disappeared 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 in over a hundred miles , we pass but two tiny towns 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 this is what it means to be remote , where the land and sun are so unforgiving none can live , and this is where the bonds that tie a nation together begin to fray 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the crowds that gathered about the car with rounded faces we saw in the morning have by afternoon given way to the thinner , lighter features of the @entity172 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 those features are often hard to see , shrouded as they are by turbans that wrap around the face 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 by instinct , by life , by tradition , they are desert mountain people 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 twice in the past two decades , they 've risen up in armed rebellion against the government 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 some joined @entity20 's forces over the border in @entity16 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the government in @entity8 worries @entity16 's war will create instability in @entity0 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 officials publicly say they fear @entity20 's weapon stockpiles could be falling into @entity194 's hands 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 privately there 's another fear , that the newly liberated guns could one day be turned on the government in another @entity172 rebellion 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 but for now a @entity172 rebellion seems the more distant possibility , because @entity201 is exploiting the @entity202 spring and every crumb of opportunity that might fall unnoticed from the battlefield 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 their drug - , gun - and people - smuggling routes through the sparsely populated land we are crossing are hungry for the sustenance turmoil can bring 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the more confusion and chaos there is , the easier it is to keep their networks hidden 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 it is these last few miles to @entity12 that worry us the most 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 @entity194 has kidnapped several foreigners in this remote region in the past few years 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we do n't want to be unlucky names added to the list 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 while our driver is holding up well , almost 12 hours at the wheel , our fuel light has been on for a while 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we 've been running on reserve 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 he stops to top up the tank from a solitary liter bottle of fuel we purchased earlier in the day 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 there have been no milestones for a while and the sun is edging down to the dirt of the desert 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we 're hoping @entity12 will soon come into view 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 how far can a four - wheel - drive off - road truck go on a liter of gas 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 then we see a red - topped stone marker come into view 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 it reads 30 kilometers , 20 or so miles , to go 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 and not a soul around 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 we 're racing the sun , our dwindling fuel and our fears 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 each bend in the road i hope will be our last 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 can the red light on the fuel gauge be any brighter 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 probably not ; it 's a trick of the fading light easily worked on tense , tired eyes 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 then , as if by clockwork , almost exactly 12 hours after we left @entity8 , @entity12 slips into view - low , dusty , dilapidated , but a delight to see 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 uniformed gendarmes and a man in orange overalls greet us at the checkpoint , lower the rope and wave , their job for the day almost done ; there can be few more drivers behind us 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 the litter - strewn streets are cluttered with vendors packing up their shabby wares 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 dust and smoke cloud the air , making it hard to see much of this town 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 with better light tomorrow we 'll get a good look at this place where @entity20 is rumored to have spent millions paving roads , putting up lights , even building a hospital 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 a few hours later as i settle in to my bed , i can only wonder at the irony 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
 @entity20 is out there somewhere on the run , and i 'll be getting a good night 's sleep in the @entity12 hotel he built 	@placeholder is rumored to have spent millions on @entity0 's infrastructure
