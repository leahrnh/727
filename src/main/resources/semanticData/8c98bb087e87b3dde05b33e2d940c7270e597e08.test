( @entity2 ) @entity1 prime minister @entity0 is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of @entity4 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 the address marks the first time in history that the head of the @entity1 government will address the entire @entity4 , and given the importance of the @entity13 - @entity1 relationship , it is an invitation long overdue 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 so far , prime minister @entity0 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to @entity4 by @entity19 prime minister @entity18 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the @entity23 nearly three - quarters of the respondents indicated they had " never heard of " @entity0 , underscoring just how difficult it is for the @entity26 administration to sell its much - vaunted " pivot " or " rebalance " to the @entity13 public 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 nevertheless , @entity0 arrives in @entity29 at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the " pivot , " the @entity34 , or @entity33 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 the @entity33 is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the @entity13 , @entity1 and 10 other @entity38 - facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 and beyond its potential economic impact , it also allows the @entity13 to expand its influence in @entity43 , providing an alternative to @entity46 - centered agreements such as the @entity47 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 the stakes , therefore , are significant 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 prominent @entity53 such as @entity55 sen	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 @entity54 and @entity57 sen	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 @entity56 , for example , have been critical of the @entity33 , arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine @entity13 sovereignty 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 but the immediate battle in @entity4 is not over the @entity33 directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or " @entity68 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 " trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the @entity33 to come before @entity4 without amendment , has been on the books for decades 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 the power to use trade promotion authority , however , must be periodically reauthorized 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 @entity4 voted narrowly to give president @entity75 trade promotion authority in 2002 , but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the @entity4 reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the @entity13 speaks with one voice 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 @entity86 control both houses of @entity4 , and are generally supportive of free trade 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 but while passage of trade promotion authority in the @entity93 is likely , the result in the @entity90 , where @entity0 will be speaking , is less certain 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 this is in part because some @entity90 @entity86 are simply loath to delegate any power to the president , while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 after all , the fact that @entity86 would actually be supporting the proposal of a @entity53 president will not prevent @entity53 -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for @entity86 among those white , working - class voters who were so crucial to @entity86 success in the 2014 midterm 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 but even if trade promotion authority passes , the fight over the @entity33 is far from over 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before @entity4 can grant final approval to the @entity33 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 this likely throws the @entity33 vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 ironically , the fact that @entity53 seem likely to nominate @entity125 , an early supporter of the @entity33 , may go a long way to blunting this attack 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 still , it is hard to see @entity129 willing to " go it alone " on the @entity33 without some @entity53 buy - in 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 which brings us back to prime minister @entity0 's speech 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity138 , there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nation 's role in that conflict 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 in the eyes of many in @entity46 and @entity147 , @entity1 has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions , while the @entity13 itself expressed disappointment over a visit @entity0 made to the controversial @entity152 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 yet despite such criticisms , a @entity23 poll found a plurality in the @entity13 thinks that the apologies that @entity1 has issued in the past about the war are sufficient 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 as a result , for much of the @entity13 audience , @entity0 's words about the @entity33 will be of equal importance to questions of history 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for @entity33 be enough to sway @entity4 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 certainly , @entity0 has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling @entity174 , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 this suggests that the big challenge for @entity0 on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the @entity33 in a way that convinces the @entity13 people that the trade agreement is not about enriching @entity13 corporations and outsourcing @entity13 jobs , but strengthening the @entity13 - @entity1 alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the @entity13 and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of @entity46 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 it 's a tall task , especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 but it 's a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand , but for the success of president @entity26 's pivot to @entity43 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
 and with that in mind , prime minister @entity0 wo n't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday 	@entity1 prime minister @entity0 will address @placeholder on wednesday
