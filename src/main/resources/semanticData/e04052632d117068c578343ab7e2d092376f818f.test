( @entity0 ) -- from the moment i stepped onto the tarmac in @entity4 two weeks ago , i was struck yet again by the sheer breadth of @entity7 's diversity -- ethnic , religious , cultural , geographic 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 it is what makes @entity7 a remarkable country , home to the world 's largest democracy 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 earlier this year , some 550 million citizens went to the polls to cast their vote , in the largest election the world has ever seen 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 as prime minister @entity20 visits @entity21 , for the first time as the leader of @entity7 , he will bring with him the aspirations and concerns of 1	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
2 billion people 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 the task before him and president @entity29 will be to reaffirm the strategic partnership between our two nations -- a partnership that relies not only on government ties but also on steadily expanding relations between our business communities , civil society groups and cultural institutions 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 the @entity38 and @entity7 form what president @entity29 has called the " defining partnership of the 21st century 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 " but this partnership can only reach its full potential if it is given the kind of attention and commitment it deserves 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 so what tone will president @entity29 set when he first sits down with the new prime minister 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 i will venture to suggest a few key points : for the sake of peace and prosperity not only in @entity54 but also globally , @entity7 and the @entity38 must work together across a range of economic , political , environmental , and security issues 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 we must recognize , however , that we will not always agree on every issue 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 that is the nature of a deep and close bilateral relationship 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 indeed , over the past year , there have been bouts of distrust , uncertainty and perceived drift , but i am convinced that both leaders have every intention of establishing a positive tone during mr	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity20 's visit 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 over the past decade , the two countries have made rapid strides towards strengthening the relationship without headline - grabbing developments ( the exception being the 2008 civil nuclear cooperation agreement ) 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 this is not a bad thing 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 significant progress has resulted from " small " steps in people - to - people exchanges , scientific collaboration , and educational exchanges that have accreted over time 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 for a first meeting between leaders of two great , and often noisy , democracies , it will be important for both sides to engage in the mutual setting of expectations 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 mr	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity20 comes to office with a set of ambitious plans for @entity7 in an era of considerable turmoil in various regions of the world , @entity7 can be a major force for stability 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity102 states with a well - established rule of law and adherence to international norms , as president @entity29 recently invoked before the @entity106 , are the best guarantors of regional stability and prosperity 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 president @entity29 's rebalance to @entity54 does not come at the expense of trans - @entity113 relations ( more important than ever in light of current events on the eastern border of @entity118 ) 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 similarly , we should welcome the prime minister 's engagement with traditional @entity38 allies in @entity54 , including @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , and emerging partners such as @entity127 , as part of his " look east and act east " policy 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 as president @entity29 underscored this past week at the @entity106 , the world faces a stark threat in @entity132 and must come together to counter extremism wherever it takes root 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 mr	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity20 's visit to the @entity137 on saturday reflects the shared suffering of our two countries at the hands of terrorists 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 since the devastating @entity145 attacks of 2008 , our cooperation against terror has grown exponentially 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity21 should continue to expand its information sharing and other counterterrorism exchanges with @entity7 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 the president should also encourage the negotiation of a new @entity150 with @entity7 , to replace one that is expiring in 2015 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 our defense cooperation is increasingly robust , featuring major naval exercises , military exchanges and high - level consultations 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 these should continue , as should the trend of @entity21 permitting higher levels of sensitive technology to be released to @entity7 defense forces 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 domestically , mr	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity20 's biggest challenge is returning @entity7 to the level of economic growth that is necessary to provide opportunity for the nation 's fast - growing , youthful workforce 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 an important part of this effort will require a focus on improving the trade and investment climate , for example , by following through on @entity7 's commitments to the @entity175 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 he has been very clear that he wants to expand the @entity7 economy by improving trade numbers and attracting more foreign investment 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 and , with his " make in @entity7 " campaign officially launched just days before his @entity38 trip , he has already signaled his commitment to turn @entity7 into a global manufacturing hub -- including by addressing the daunting regulatory challenges that investors , both foreign and domestic , face 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 this is an encouraging sign 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 @entity7 and the @entity38 share the objective to build a strong manufacturing base and create jobs 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 this should be an area of cooperation between our countries , not a point of conflict 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 both @entity7 and the @entity38 must commit to rebuilding mutual trust and focus on moving our partnership forward 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
 the world has too much to gain for these two great democracies to do otherwise 	@entity203 : @placeholder , @entity38 should cooperate , build partnership for economic growth
