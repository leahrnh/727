( @entity0 ) -- it took five tries and almost 15 years , but there is no question that @entity6 's successful launch of a satellite into orbit on december 11 is a major technological achievement 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 it is not , however , a serious military threat to the @entity12 or other nations 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity6 still has a long way to go before they can turn the orbiting of a baby satellite , reportedly tumbling out of control , into the ability to threaten others at long distance with a nuclear weapon 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 if the past is any guide , @entity6 's launch of an @entity25 rocket will have international security repercussions far out of proportion to its military capability 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity6 's first attempt in launching a satellite in april 1998 under @entity33 failed , but it triggered a panic in the @entity35 of elaborate anti-missile weapons seized on the launch as proof that dictators of small , undeterrable countries could soon attack the @entity12 with nuclear - armed intercontinental ballistic missiles 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations

 at the time , a commission chaired by @entity44 made headlines with its warning that " a nation with a well - developed , scud - based ballistic missile infrastructure would be able to achieve first flight of a long - range missile , up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile range ( greater than 5,500 kilometers ) , within about five years of deciding to do so 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 " @entity6 and @entity52 had @entity54 - based missile infrastructures : they were clearly trying to do so 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 fifteen years later , they have not come close to succeeding 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 but the warning achieved its purpose : missile defense programs and budgets soared and have never come down 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 our nation today spends about $ 10 billion a year on such programs , even though the threat never developed as predicted 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 we can expect similar warnings now that @entity66 has done what his father never could 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 and this is the really tragic news 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 success raises stakes for @entity12 missile defense system governments meeting in emergency session in @entity75 and @entity76 will have to produce more than statements of condemnation 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 they will likely support more anti-missile programs 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the @entity12 , feeling the pressure from them and from defense hawks at home , may increase efforts to field more of the systems it is developing 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 we deploy about 30 ground - based interceptors in silos in @entity91 and @entity92 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 these systems have some ability to hit a long - range rocket , like the @entity25 should it be turned into a missile and aimed at the @entity12 some in @entity97 will no doubt demand that we deploy more 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 we are fielding interceptors at sea aboard @entity102 - class destroyers and cruisers that have some capability against short - range missiles , with plans to grow the program to longer - range missiles and deploy them in @entity110 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the @entity111 just recently approved arms sales to @entity113 to help that nation upgrade its @entity102 anti-missile system 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 pressures will mount to deploy more capable anti-missile systems in @entity118 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 read more : @entity6 silences doubters , raises fears with rocket launch @entity122 and @entity123 will almost certainly react to these deployments , believing that they are aimed at them , not @entity6 or @entity52 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 this will chill efforts to negotiate reductions in @entity131 stockpiles of nuclear weapons 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 how can we reduce , they will ask , if the @entity12 is racing to ring us with new weapons 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 there is no reason for this cycle of action and reaction 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 there is no threat that warrants the panicked deployment of untested and unreliable anti-missile weapons 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 as my colleague and @entity6 expert @entity145 notes , " a successful launch was only a matter of time , and it shows a level of technical sophistication that was always there 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 we need to take @entity6 seriously but not make it more than it really is 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 " i pointed out in 2009 , after @entity6 's third failed attempt , that the nation was a long way from having a nuclear - armed icbm 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 that is still true after this successful launch 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity6 would have to achieve three additional breakthroughs 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 first , it would have to demonstrate the reliability of its launcher 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the first four tests failed 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 this one succeeded 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 will the next 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 sometimes , you really do have to be a rocket scientist to answer questions like this 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the one i consult is @entity172 of the @entity173 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 he writes , " from past launches , we knew that @entity6 has been able to build or buy working components for a rocket 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the main difficulty is getting all the parts to work together and at the same time , given the enormous complexity of rockets 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 even with this success , @entity6 has no confidence in the reliability of the rocket , which undermines its utility for military purposes 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 " second , it will have to develop a nuclear warhead small enough and reliable enough to fit on a missile 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity6 ( unlike @entity52 ) has twice tested nuclear devices , but these are believed to be too large and heavy for use in a warhead 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity6 would need several more nuclear tests to achieve this capability 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations

 @entity6 will have to develop and test a re-entry vehicle that can survive the temperatures , pressures and vibration of coming back into the @entity205 's atmosphere and the accuracy to land where targeted 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 it is a long journey from initial satellite launch to an icbm 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 ask @entity52 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 @entity52 first launched a low - @entity205 orbit - satellite in 2009 , the same feat @entity6 has now duplicated , but @entity52 does not now , nor is it likely to have anytime soon , an icbm 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 a new study from the @entity216 concludes that contrary to predictions in the late 1990s that @entity52 or @entity6 or both would have icbms by 2015 , " it is increasingly uncertain whether @entity52 will be able to achieve an icbm capability by 2015 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 " so , the lessons are : do n't underestimate @entity6 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 do n't count on this regime disappearing anytime soon 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 but do n't panic 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 do n't start an arms race that undermines your greater strategic stability goals 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 we need to take a deep breath and work with our allies to get @entity6 back to the bargaining table and off the test ranges 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 	@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @placeholder or other nations
