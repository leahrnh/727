 @entity5 faced far more daunting challenges in @entity14 when he assumed command there in early 2007 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 those challenges , and how they were overcome , are worth recalling as he assumes command in @entity10 , as they may provide some indicators of the way forward there 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 first , @entity14 was embroiled in a vicious civil war in which @entity28 and @entity30 civilians were showing up dead on the streets of @entity14 's cities at the rate of 90 a day , some tortured in the most unspeakable manner , their heads drilled open 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency

 the war was so violent that almost five million @entity14 -- around a fifth of the population -- fled their homes for the safety of other countries or internal exile 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 relatively few of those refugees have since returned 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency

 last year some 2,400 @entity10 civilians died in the war -- too many , of course , but in @entity14 when @entity5 took command , 3,200 civilians were dying every month , making @entity14 around 15 times more violent than @entity10 is today , when adjusted for relative population size 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 and contrary to the old saw that @entity10 are virulently opposed to foreign forces on their soil , a @entity78 / @entity77 poll taken earlier this year -- almost a decade after the fall of the @entity9 -- found that 62 percent of @entity10 support international forces in their country 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency

 this is a critical point in @entity10 , as the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency is the protection of the population itself , a theory of counterinsurgency warfare that @entity5 enshrined in @entity2 military doctrine , when he oversaw the work on the unglamorously named @entity95 3 - 24 in 2006 at the @entity97 's training center at @entity98 , @entity99 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency

 the following points from the manual summarize its central message : " unsuccessful practices : overemphasize killing and capturing the enemy rather than securing and engaging the populace ; conduct large - scale operations as the norm and concentrate military forces in large bases for protection 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 " successful practices , according to the manual : focus on the population , its needs , and its security , and provide amnesty and rehabilitation for those willing to support the new government 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
 in a section titled " paradoxes , " the manual made a number of recommendations that were hardly typical of prevailing @entity2 military doctrine : " sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction " and " the host nation doing something tolerably is normally better than @entity2 doing it well 	gen. @placeholder , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
