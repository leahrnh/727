( @entity0 ) -- should unauthorized disclosures of classified information be praised or condemned 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the events of recent weeks -- and the disclosures of @entity5 in particular -- have propelled this question to the forefront of public debate 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 unfortunately , the responses have been polarized , with some hailing leakers as patriots , and others condemning them as traitors 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 some have cited the @entity15 to make the case that @entity5 was justified in revealing secrets 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 as is often the case , the truth is more complicated 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the first thing to bear in mind is that employees such as @entity5 volunteer to be entrusted with classified information 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 when they disclose secrets , they are violating the trust that they have asked to be placed in themselves 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 and they are public employees ( even if they happen to be contractors rather than permanent employees ) 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the @entity32 : a glance at opinions about the @entity36 leaker this means that when they disclose secrets , they are disobeying not only their supervisors , but also the public , whose representatives have enacted laws and regulations relating to the handling of classified information 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 finally , it is not personal secrets that these employees are revealing but state secrets 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 as such , their actions endanger their fellow citizens when they undermine security operations 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 in sum , when a government employee makes an unauthorized disclosure he is violating trust , disobeying the law and potentially endangering others 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 these are points worth absorbing before cheering on leakers and whistle - blowers as " patriots 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 " this does not mean that an employee can never be justified in making an unauthorized disclosure 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 an employee could uncover activity so heinous that he feels confident that citizens and overseers would want to know about it so that they could punish the wrongdoers 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 this could be activity that is obviously criminal or clearly immoral 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 an example would be the inhumane practices employed at @entity79 prison , whose disclosure led to the prosecution of wrongdoers rather than the complainant 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the recent disclosures do not meet this standard though -- @entity5 does not claim to have exposed criminal activity 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 well , has he uncovered activity that is clearly seen as immoral by his fellow citizens 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 this is questionable since polls suggest that at least half the country favors secret electronic surveillance and disapproves of his actions 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 is it enough that @entity5 thinks that the @entity36 's program is morally wrong 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 this argument is obviously problematic 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 for if @entity5 is allowed to break the law whenever he likes , then why should n't others 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 should we allow a fiscal conservative in the military to reveal a nuclear weapons programs he deems too expensive 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 should a @entity106 officer who supports @entity107 be allowed to disclose the use of a decoy @entity110 because the increased carbon emissions hurt his conscience 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 what these hypotheticals make clear is that when officials break the law they must be able to give reasons why we the public would want the secret exposed , not why they would want the secret exposed 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 perhaps it will be argued that @entity5 thought the program violated the @entity124 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 it is worth asking : what happens when an employee becomes aware of a secret policy or operation whose lawfulness might be unclear to him , perhaps because the law is vague or because he worries that overseers are unaware of the activity in question 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 under these circumstances , the employee would be justified in bringing his concern to the attention of higher - ups 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 should he fear retaliation , he might even be justified in approaching law enforcement or even lawmakers 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 but once he knows that lawmakers and federal judges have also consented to the secret activity in question ( as in the @entity150 case ) , then the employee 's options are considerably narrower 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 if the policy or operation violates his conscience , then he ought to resign 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 but if he now decides to disclose the secret policy or operation , then he must accept the legal consequences 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 why 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 because by subverting the decisions of the president , @entity159 , and the courts , the employee has undermined the authority that the people have vested in these representative institutions 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 therefore to refuse now to submit to the law , to flee overseas , as @entity5 has done , is to show contempt for democracy and the rule of law 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 if an employee believes that he has broken the law for reasons that his fellow citizens will understand , then he ought to be willing to take his chances before a jury ( as in the @entity175 case ) 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the moral limits outlined above will be rejected by those who praise unauthorized disclosures 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 they will insist that unauthorized disclosures advance democracy and @entity182 values because transparency is democratic and secrecy is un-american 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 but this argument can not be taken seriously 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 after all , there are things that the public itself may not want to know , which is why our elected representatives have enacted laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of classified information 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 or are our public officials only allowed to keep secrets when unelected and unaccountable government contractors agree that they may 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 if that is what we believe , then why have a president 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 or hold elections 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 indeed , why have a @entity203 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 just let the contractors run the show 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 opinion : @entity5 is a hero it is also worth recalling that the @entity203 was not written solely to promote transparency 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 there are other important values that must also be taken into account , such as the need for what the @entity15 called " energy " in government , i	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
e	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 , the capacity to act speedily and secretly in the national interest 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 this point is often forgotten by those advocating on behalf of employees who make unauthorized disclosures 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 " has @entity223 's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as ' quaint ' as the @entity227 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says

 proponents of transparency also love to cite @entity254 , the @entity254 , who once said that " a popular government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says

 to see what @entity270 really thought about secrecy it is worth recalling the case of @entity275 , @entity276 's delegate to the @entity159 , who leaked to the @entity278 news of a friendly overture from @entity280 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 @entity275 leaked the news , which had been recorded in the @entity282 on @entity284 's request , because he believed it vindicated his stance that the @entity182 would be able to mend its war - ravaged finances by raising new loans in @entity289 , and that @entity159 therefore did not have to impose a 5 % import duty that @entity276 opposed 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 claiming to have informed his constituents of " such things as they have a right to know , " @entity275 subsequently defended his action before the @entity159 as an exercise of " the freedom of speech 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 " sound familiar 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 guess how his colleagues -- our revered founders -- reacted 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 @entity275 's response , @entity254 observes in his " @entity301 , " provoked " universal indignation , " because his colleagues viewed his actions as having betrayed the @entity280 and presented the public with a distorted picture of the @entity182 ' financial dealings that could not be corrected without revealing " many delicate transactions 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 " not surprisingly , then , @entity275 's defense of his action was formally condemned -- on @entity312 's motion -- as " highly derogatory to the honor and dignity of the @entity182 in @entity159 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 " to be clear , the fact that secrecy has long been seen as being in the public interest does not give officials carte blanche to do as they like 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 secrecy needs to be balanced against important civil liberties 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the central question is : who should do the balancing 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the reason the @entity203 entrusts the business of balancing values to the three branches is because the officials in charge are chosen by the people and are in a position to check each other , especially with respect to secret policies or operations that it would be self - defeating to make public 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 so when an individual decides to short - circuit or circumvent this careful arrangement , he must only do so when there is reason to believe that representatives from all three branches have allowed grave wrongdoing to go unchecked 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 otherwise , an unauthorized disclosure is nothing more than an effort to impose one 's own narrow political view on one 's fellow citizens 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 in such a case , it is the leaker , not state secrecy , that poses an " existential threat " to @entity182 democracy 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity360 	framers of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @placeholder opposed leaking of secrets , he says
