 @entity1 kicked off this effort with a @entity47 chat last week 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2 - degree threshold , specifically 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem

 @entity90 , an economist at @entity91 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 @entity90 , 73 , proposed the 2 - degree threshold in a 1977 ( 1977 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 ) paper titled " economic growth and climate : the @entity95 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " the estimate was " crude , but it was a reasonable first start , " he told me 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature , this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years , " he wrote in " @entity99 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " a growing body of research now supports the idea 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2 - degree world is something none of us should want 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " you need a judgment call for these things , " said @entity118 , chair of the @entity119 , who has written on the history of 2 degrees @entity6 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " and this 2 - degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " @entity130 was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal , @entity118 told me 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 that happened in the 1990s 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 later came the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the @entity136 and , most significantly , the @entity137 , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 the @entity140 was among the signatories 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 i 'm going to spend the month of may exploring this question , so look for more on this 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post- 2 - degree world to look like 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 these are pulled from reports by the @entity151 , the @entity152 and the @entity153 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 wildfires in the @entity140 are expected to increase 400 % to 800 % in size 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 a range of species will be at risk for extinction , particularly amphibians 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 the @entity152 estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at " increasingly high risk of extinction " at or near the 2 - degree mark 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 the @entity166 is expected keep melting , losing 30 % of its annual average sea ice 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 certain crop yields in the @entity140 , @entity171 and @entity172 are expected to decrease 10 % to 30 % 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem

 " no one knows , exactly 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 @entity202 , a climate scientist at @entity204 , told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 how many cigarettes give you cancer 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 no one knows , exactly 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 but the more you smoke , the more you up your risk 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 and 2 degrees , policy experts agree , is certainly risky territory 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 plus , everyone hates a fraction 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 targeting 1 degree of warming is " ridiculous because you ca n't do it , " said @entity90 , the economist 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " three sounds too high 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem

5 degrees simply based on the pollution we 're already putting into the atmosphere , even with " very ambitious mitigation action " to reduce carbon emissions , according to a 2014 report from the @entity153 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 some of that warming is " locked - in to the @entity238 's atmospheric system , " that organization says 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem

 yes , but it wo n't be easy 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 " if you want to stay below 2 degrees , you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree , " said @entity118 from the @entity119 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 here 's the best guess for what that " amazing speed " might need to look like : cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 % to 90 % by 2050 , said @entity250 , global director of the climate program at the @entity253 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem

 if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate , we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 scarier still , we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2 - degree target , saying it 's too ambitious , or even naive 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 but we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that " north star " to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 if you think 2 degrees sounds bad , 5 degrees is far , far worse 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
 the @entity152 expects a 5 - degree world to be characterized by " major extinctions around the globe " and a " reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide 	@placeholder : this one little number is significant as a way to focus world 's attention on problem
