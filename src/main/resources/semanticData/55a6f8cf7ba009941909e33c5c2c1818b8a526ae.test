( @entity0 ) geography is , in part , destiny for @entity3 : the country will always be a bridge between @entity6 and @entity7 , as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the @entity9 so starkly shows 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 @entity3 's empire never rivaled that of the @entity43 and the @entity44 in scope and longevity , but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 indeed , the migrants traversing the @entity9 today form part of a century - long chain of migrations , expulsions , and exiles sparked by @entity3 's imperial ambition and commercial interests , the post-colonial anger of @entity57 leaders , and now mass economic desperation and political strife 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 long after the formal end of @entity3 colonialism , these @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity15 have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 @entity15 is an example of the long reach of @entity3 imperialism 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 @entity15 was for a brief period an incorporated province of @entity3 , on the model of @entity72 , and @entity15 families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship 's persecution of those who resisted @entity3 occupation 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 over 100,000 @entity15 men , women , and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s , and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 @entity84 , who ruled from 1969 to 2011 , was born during the @entity3 occupation of his country , and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as @entity91 , who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 in 1970 , soon after he took power , @entity84 struck back , expelling the remaining @entity3 community in @entity15 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 commercial concerns , and the cozy relationship of then - prime minister @entity114 and @entity84 , also lay behind a historic 2008 @entity115 between @entity3 and @entity15 , which promised infrastructure and other aid to @entity15 worth the equivalent of $ 5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by @entity3 during the decades of colonial rule 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 until his death in 2011 , despite deals with @entity3 and the @entity124 to control departures from his borders , @entity84 intermittently used @entity7 fears of mass arrivals of migrants from @entity15 as a political weapon 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 given @entity7 's geography , this weapon was pointed particularly at @entity3 , @entity15 's former master , and the principal target of @entity84 's post-colonial revenge politics 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 this colonial history and its long - term consequences can help us understand @entity3 ' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 @entity3 rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly , and yet migrants who remain in @entity3 are often subject to racist attacks 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder

 the @entity3 government deserves the full support of the @entity124 as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
 but it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past 	@entity219 : @entity3 's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the @placeholder
