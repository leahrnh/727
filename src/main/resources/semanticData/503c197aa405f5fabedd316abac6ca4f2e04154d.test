( @entity1 ) the new emojis are here 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 on thursday , @entity2 released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 the reaction to this new lineup is , as should be expected with almost anything new in today 's hypersensitive climate , a range of cheers and jeers 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 why is any of this important , you may ask 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 for many , these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream @entity36 -- despite what others might say 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 this matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 or more accurately , think of a white face smiling because up until thursday 's update , all the emojis had pale skin 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 but that has all changed 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 now there 's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from , including yellow , brown and black 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 i 'm sure few people will be upset with this development 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 but how about in december 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 why 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji , and that will also include 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 @entity63 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 that shrieking sound you may have heard was from @entity67 ' @entity66 , who famously stated in 2013 that @entity63 is absolutely , definitely and without a doubt a white guy 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 in fact , thanks to @entity2 , we may even see @entity73 emojis this december 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 ( could that mean he 's a @entity75 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 @entity76 even more shrieking from @entity67 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 ) there is more 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 @entity2 has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis , kissing with a heart over their heads 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 this inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on @entity84 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 it 's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same - sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of " religious liberty 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 " but it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 @entity95 presidential candidates might have to say about " gay emojis 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 " and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as @entity2 has done , comes at some peril 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 apparently @entity119 is overjoyed that finally @entity2 has included it 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 but @entity120 are not happy they were left out 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 i must admit that being partially of @entity124 heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a @entity124 state , @entity2 has chosen to now include a @entity124 flag emoji 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 @entity120 , i feel your pain 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 of course the bigger question in the whole diverse - emoji issue is : what took @entity2 so long 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 that the company ( finally ) did is a step in the right direction : @entity36 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 @entity2 has " evolved " in showing diversity -- from brown people to same - sex couples 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
 maybe " religious liberty " conservatives who discriminate will follow 	@entity150 : @placeholder 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
