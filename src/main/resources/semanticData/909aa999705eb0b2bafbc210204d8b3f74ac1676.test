( @entity1 ) it 's time for liberals to look local 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 with @entity7 gridlocked over almost everything and congressional @entity10 standing firm against any further expansion of domestic policy , the odds of @entity4 passing another @entity5 or @entity6 are minimal 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 it will take a lot of work by @entity17 voters and activists to change the numbers on @entity20 so that liberal ideas stand a chance of passing 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 yet at the state and local level , the story has been much different 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 @entity27 have found more political space to move forward with their initiatives 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 in @entity31 , mayor @entity30 has launched an ambitious pre-k education program to broaden access for all of the city 's residents 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 in @entity36 , the mayor has put together a generous housing program to guarantee that there are no veterans without shelter 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the drive for same - sex marriage equality took hold in the states before reaching the federal level 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 states such as @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity7 as well as @entity49 have taken the lead in adopting eco-friendly policies 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 while @entity4 has resisted president @entity53 's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
10 from $ 7	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
25 , 21 states and the @entity7 went ahead and enacted minimum wage increases of their own 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 this is just the tip of the iceberg 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 at the annual conference for @entity62 in @entity7 last week , the focus was on innovation 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the most exciting ideas are taking hold at the local level 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 as the @entity69 's @entity68 explained to the audience , when one moves beneath the gridlock of @entity7 and down to the towns and communities of @entity62 , it is quickly possible to see the " functionality of politics " -- where partisanship does not trump the need to solve problems 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 this has given liberals an opening 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 in @entity84 , a company called @entity85 is taking food scraps from local eating establishments and transforming them into compost for gardens to nurture communities and lower the environmental footprint of the city , @entity82 said at the @entity62 conference 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 @entity94 , the founding president and ceo of @entity96 , explained how his organization assists local governments to develop global partnerships that help lower - and middle - income @entity100 gain greater access to banking services 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 but many liberal democrats are uneasy about embracing this trend 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 since the @entity5 in the 1930s , which followed the total collapse of the patchwork of local and state social welfare programs overwhelmed by the weight of the @entity115 , doing things at the national level has been seen as the only way to go 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 only by making programs national could policymakers ensure that state and local government officials ( particularly @entity121 who had little taste for giving benefits to african - americans ) could not distribute benefits only to certain portions of the population 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 only the federal government had the taxing power necessary to sustain robust domestic initiatives 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 in this view , it was believed that only @entity7 policymakers could bring together the best and brightest minds to make sure that programs were designed and administered well 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 only through centralized programs , could policymakers ensure that residents of one state did n't receive more meager benefits than in other places 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 some programs , like climate change , can only work well if every state has to follow the rules 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 for the time being , liberals need to abandon that bias 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 even if all the fears are warranted , right now there are enough benefits to justify more local programs 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the most important obviously is simply practical 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 this is the only opportunity that liberals have right now of seriously moving forward with new ideas 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 local and state politics are also proving to be arenas for great experimentation 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 this is one of the lessons of the 1910s and 1920s , when liberal activists in states such as @entity31 and @entity165 experimented with programs ranging from unemployment insurance to the regulation of work conditions 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 as @entity179 wrote , a " state , may if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 " local policymakers and experts developed these programs for many years before they were ever brought to the national stage 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the result is that the policies were stronger and better tested , and some of the bad ideas had been discarded after it became clear they did n't work 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 when @entity190 came to office in the 1930s , he looked to these programs for inspiration about what to do at the national level 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the same was true in the 1960s when @entity198 and the @entity4 put together civil rights , anti-poverty and urban development programs that had been implemented at the state level 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 it was easier for federal officials to build support for their proposals when they could point to successful experiments 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 voters could see how they could work and how some of the worst predictions of opponents had not come true 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 conservatives have done the same in recent decades 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 when republicans pushed for welfare reform in 1996 , they drew many ideas from local changes that had been put into place in states such as @entity165 , which had received waivers from national requirements 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 the local arena is usually not ideal for creating big domestic policies since it depends on so many actors to sustain , since the politics of each region vary so greatly and since the financial muscle of smaller levels of government is much weaker 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 outside @entity7 's more conservative environment , political conditions in many parts of the @entity100 are producing important opportunities for liberalism to flourish 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
 this vibrant period of local policymaking will help to prepare the groundwork for the next moment -- like the early 1930s or mid- 1960s or during the financial crisis of 2008 - 2010 -- when the doors for legislating will open in @entity7 	trying programs out locally can set groundwork for @placeholder action in coming years , he says
