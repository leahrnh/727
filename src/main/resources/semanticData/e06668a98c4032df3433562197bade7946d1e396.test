@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- it 's been five years since @entity3 journeyed to @entity4 in search of true love on the series finale of " @entity8 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 " she appeared to have found it in the arms of @entity11 , and she returned to @entity0 -- and her now - settled friends -- ready for a new start 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity14 was a driving force in creating the " @entity8 " movie 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 then came the inevitable cry : that 's it 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 what happens next 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity14 , who played @entity3 , wanted to find out as well 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 but the situation had to be right , she said , which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together , fell apart and came together again 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 now that the movie is out , @entity26 -- who 's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big - screen " @entity8 " with " @entity33 " anchor @entity32 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 the following is an edited version of that interview 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity1 : i think a lot of fans , maybe a lot of people , and those of you among the cast , did n't think this day would actually ever come 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 but here we are 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 so how are you feeling deep inside , @entity14 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity14 : i feel extraordinarily privileged 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i 've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it 's a once - in - a - lifetime kind of professional experience and one really should n't be greedy enough to ask for it twice 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 watch the cast talk about the thrill of " @entity8 " » i have to say that , this last six , eight months , was better than those seven years [ the show aired ] and i think it 's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you do n't get to tell twice 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it has been , i must say , worth every obstacle and dead end , and fit and start , and every moment that was seemingly impossible 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it has been a dream 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity1 : and i imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read , which was , from my understanding , the first time you all actually were in the same room [ together ] regardless of how much you kept in touch 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 tell me a little bit about that moment 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity26 : i started putting [ the ] script back together in april of 2006 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 and that [ table read ] was a really extraordinary day , because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity81 [ @entity82 ] had been away and @entity83 [ @entity84 ] had been away and @entity85 [ @entity86 ] had been [ doing ] his other job , and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it was a kind of reunion that is very , very special , because you really want to be there 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it 's not the reunion where you 're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it 's the reunion that you want 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i think even more so was that first day on [ the ] set 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 when we thought , good @entity108 , [ writer / director ] @entity109 [ @entity111 ] and i are actually making this movie , like we got it done , we 're here , we 're doing it -- what a privilege 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity1 : i think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on " @entity123 , " because the energy was 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 palpable 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 but we 're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 ( rumors have abounded about friction between the stars 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 ) one of my producers said while we were watching the tv , " are they going to sit near each other 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 " " why are they putting @entity85 in the middle of all of them 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 " hearing that , does it make you mad 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity26 : i find it slightly -- it 's not that i 'm mad 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i expect better from people 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i think it 's really beneath me , to keep defending myself 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i have a 35 - year career 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i have an impeccable character , i really pride myself in my work ethic and the way i treat people 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 and i think @entity81 would say the same and @entity148 would say the same 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 and i love @entity81 , and i wanted her to be in this movie 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 we could n't have done it without her , we could n't have done it without @entity83 , we could n't have done it without @entity148 [ @entity155 ] , nor could we have done it without @entity85 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 watch @entity82 address the rumors » you know , this is a story that people like to tell about women 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 why 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i do n't know 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 is it that interesting 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 probably not 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 so once again i just have to say it does n't define the experience 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 nobody can take the experience away 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 it 's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity1 : you seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to , being at the game as long as you 've been 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 to that end , one of the things that i 've always admired about you and [ husband ] @entity183 [ @entity184 ] and i think a lot of people do , is how you 've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 now i know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you do n't talk about your private lives , which is great and i applaud that 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 that said , is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity26 : i would n't make any proclamations about why i have a marriage that , to me , is successful 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 i would just say that we 've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 this is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia , and the movie industry fits into it in some small way , but there are a lot of people of important interest and i think that it 's a conscious choice to live in a place where we 're bumping up against humanity 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 we run to the market on our own , we take the subway , and we integrate into our city , and we become a part of the fabric and i think it 's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we do n't have paparazzi every single day at our house 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 no , but it is a city where you ca n't live behind a gate , you ca n't drive up in a car and be protected 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 you walk out the door and it is what it is 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 so you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity1 : is it the end of " @entity8 " 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 what does your gut tell you 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 @entity26 : my gut tells me it 's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 the future is dictated not by us at this point , and i think @entity109 and i have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen , that we have n't thought about the future 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 doing this was more than we could have asked for 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
 so anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way 	@placeholder : " @entity8 " " has been a dream "
