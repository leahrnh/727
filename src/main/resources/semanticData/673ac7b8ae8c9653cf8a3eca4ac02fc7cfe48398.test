 " if you ever need a friend to talk to , you can reach out to me , " she wrote 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " sorry , but do i know you 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " he responded 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting

 like him , she was 18 , and " my breathing is pretty crappy and i see you are in the hospital 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 i 'm sorry 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 i know it sucks 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 but you just got ta stay strong 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " messages between the two flew back and forth 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 they realized they were falling in love 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 for most other couples , the next step would be to meet in person 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 but for @entity7 and @entity8 , that was complicated -- and dangerous 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting

 dr	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity31 at the @entity32 , @entity7 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face - to - face meetings with other @entity37 patients were a bad idea 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 in their online conversations , one of the first things @entity8 told @entity7 about himself was that he had @entity42 , a horribly dangerous infection for people with @entity37 " i was like , ' hi , i 'm @entity8 from @entity44 and i have @entity42 , ' because it 's such a big deal in the @entity37 community , " he remembers 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " i left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " @entity7 listened to her heart , even if it might hurt her lungs 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 she asked @entity8 to come visit her in @entity53 , @entity54 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " i told @entity8 i 'd rather be happy -- like really , really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years , " @entity7 says 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " that was definitely something i had to think about , but when you have those feelings , you just know 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " so on august 28 , 2009 , @entity8 drove more than six hours from @entity60 , @entity44 , to @entity7 's hometown in @entity53 , @entity54 , where they 'd arranged to meet at the @entity63 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 at 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- @entity7 got out of her car and saw @entity8 leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " my heart was racing , but i just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello , " she remembers 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting

 later the young couple drove around @entity53 , and @entity8 gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday , which was two days before 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 their health quickly deteriorated , and within months , the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 too ill to work , @entity8 quit his job at his family 's auto repair shop , and @entity7 quit hers as a store clerk 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 in august , 2014 , the couple entered the @entity93 together to wait for new lungs 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity8 's came first , and on november 17 , he had his transplant 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 despite his @entity42 , which makes transplants more complicated , it was a success 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " i was so thrilled 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 i was so happy for him , " @entity7 says 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 the month after @entity8 's surgery , @entity93 discharged @entity7 -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 when she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital , but @entity93 informed her she 'd used up her supply of @entity105 days and would n't accept her 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity105 -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- would n't pay for another hospitalization until @entity7 had been out of the hospital for sixty days 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 but @entity7 was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days , much less sixty 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 so @entity7 relied on @entity112 , public insurance that was supplied by her home state of @entity54 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 she was admitted to the @entity115 , where she was cared for by @entity116 , her beloved pulmonologist 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 but then , another hurdle 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity31 explained that most lung transplant centers , including the two in @entity54 , do n't do transplants on patients with @entity42 , referring them to larger centers like @entity93 that have more experience with such complicated cases 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity7 and @entity8 , now 24 and 23 , were desperate 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 her doctors predicted she would n't live a year without new lungs 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 going on her husband 's private insurance was n't an option , since @entity8 is on his father 's policy 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 in february , @entity31 wrote a letter to @entity112 , pleading with them to make an exception and pay for @entity7 's care at @entity93 , even though it was out of state 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 @entity112 denied his plea , and that 's when the squabbling began 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 in a statement to @entity0 , a spokeswoman for the @entity143 pointed the finger at @entity93 , saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a @entity112 provider 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " @entity112 policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out - of - state providers in such situations , " wrote the spokeswoman , @entity148 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " @entity93 reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a @entity112 provider , the @entity153 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 will be happy to expedite their application 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " @entity93 counters that @entity112 told them that if they want to care for @entity7 , they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept @entity112 patients 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 while @entity93 spokeswoman @entity160 did n't elaborate , a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large - scale coverage of out - of - state @entity112 patients as payments under such programs are typically very low 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take @entity112 is " an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single - case agreements that we have signed with other state medicaid programs , " @entity160 wrote 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " @entity93 wants to help @entity7 , and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 it is up to @entity112 to address this situation 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " today , @entity7 waits in limbo in her hospital bed , hoping that the three parties -- @entity105 , @entity112 , and @entity93 -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " i feel like they 're putting a dollar sign on my life , " she says 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " i do n't want to die because of money 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 that 's stupid 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 nobody should have to do that 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
 " if @entity7 does n't get her transplant , not only will she die , but she 'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection , which could be deadly for him as he 's on drugs to suppress his immune system 	@entity8 received a lung transplant , but @placeholder is still waiting
