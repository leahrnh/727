( @entity2 ) last week , @entity1 gov	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 @entity0 ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state 's history 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 his action was driven by a specific crisis unique to @entity1 at the moment -- the severe drought now in its fourth year there -- but it has significance for the whole nation 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 as it has in the past , @entity1 is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect the physical limits imposed by planet earth 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 @entity1 developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase , historically speaking 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 this led to a system that all but encourages heavy water use in dry parts of the state , with little consistency in allocation or pricing and little disincentive to waste 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 this has never made a lot of sense , but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it just is n't tenable today in a serious drought 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 as for the drought : it wo n't be the last , and surely wo n't be the worst to come in the remainder of this century 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 @entity0 's measures may be temporary , but we can hope that they 'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state 's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users , who are not included in the current measures , although they are the dominant consumers of @entity1 's water 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 how the drought affects rest of the nation what @entity1 does now has global significance : lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 on the @entity70 subcontinent , where supply ca n't meet the demands of rapid development , groundwater is being depleted much as it is in @entity1 , and is an equally unsustainable practice in both places 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 and my colleagues at @entity78 recently published a study arguing that drought in @entity81 was one of the causes of the ongoing war there 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 they also presented strong evidence that the @entity81 drought was in part attributable to human - induced climate change -- in itself , another physical constraint the planet places on growth 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 our energy systems , like our water systems , are not sustainable 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 is the @entity1 drought a consequence of climate change 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 a recent @entity101 report for which my colleague @entity102 was lead author , argued that it is n't ( though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil ) 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 @entity1 , and southwestern @entity109 , indeed saw worse " megadroughts " in the pre-columbian past , long before any humans burned fossil fuels 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 at the same time , the latest projections are that the odds of such megadroughts are increasing with warming 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 so we 're left with a complex picture , one typical of many extreme weather events 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 we know that human - induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen , while at the same time we ca n't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 does it matter whether the drought is climate - change - induced or not 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 from a pragmatic public relations perspective , maybe 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them , and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 at least in principle , this awareness can help to build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 i lived in @entity143 for a year in 2007 - 08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years -- and that led to water restrictions in nearly all the country 's major cities 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought was n't clear either , the hardship nonetheless made @entity143 much more concerned about climate change than @entity155 were at the time 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 polls showed that the issue played a significant role in the national elections held during my year there , with a climate - denialist government falling to a much more climate - proactive one ( though the pendulum has since swung back ) 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 but being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event should n't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 whether we 're talking about a drought in @entity1 , a hurricane on the @entity177 , a flood in the @entity179 or a tornado outbreak on the @entity181 , the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 the reality and seriousness of human - caused global warming , however , is n't 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 the scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate , and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species , does n't rest on single - event attribution , but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 that big picture is what should motivate us 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 and when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable , in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human - induced vs	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 natural 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 @entity1 could have had this drought , and worse , without global warming 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 similarly , sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal floods , but cities such as @entity215 , @entity216 and many others were ( and are ) too vulnerable already 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 because really extreme events are by definition rare , most places have n't seen the worst nature can deliver , even without climate change , in their recent histories 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 so our development planning has tended to proceed under the assumption that that worst wo n't happen , leaving us with infrastructures that are n't properly adapted even to the current climate 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making @entity1 's water distribution system less wasteful , or @entity216 's subways more flood - proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 they may not be enough , in the long term , but they 're a start 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 we call these " no - regrets " measures , because they are good ideas regardless of how rapidly or slowly global warming proceeds 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
 if @entity1 can teach the rest of us something about how to design and implement such measures for water , it will be an upside to what otherwise is nothing but a slow - moving disaster 	@entity250 : @placeholder 's steps against drought are a preview for rest of @entity155 and world
