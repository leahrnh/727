( @entity5 ) from banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce , @entity0 built his vast business empire from scratch 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the @entity9 tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 these days , his @entity12 spans over 20 countries and he 's been called " @entity15 's youngest billionaire 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 " in late 2013 @entity0 joined forces with the former boss of @entity18 -- @entity19 -- to start an investment fund focused on @entity15 called @entity21 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the powerful duo raised $ 325 million through a share flotation - well above the $ 250 million target 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 but his vision spans beyond @entity15 , and @entity26 -- @entity0 was the first @entity27 to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with @entity31 's company , @entity30 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 's @entity32 spoke to @entity0 about @entity27 innovation , entrepreneurship and collaboration 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 an edited version of the interview follows 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : you are active in several @entity27 countries 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 how is the current business landscape on the continent 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity0 : right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent , i have never seen so much global excitement around @entity15 that i 've seen today 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 unfortunately , it 's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 you 've got to remember , as @entity15 , we are 54 countries 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues , but that can not be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the @entity27 continent 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : we have a very young demographic -- 85 % of our populations are under the age of 35 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 yet , entrepreneurship is not in the education system 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 and it 's something , frankly , that i am extremely passionate about , because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants , etc	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 it 's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 so , it 's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system , and innovation is totally embedded into that 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : what is it about @entity15 that encourages innovation 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : the biggest advantage we have at the moment , and you 've seen this with mobile phone penetration , is that we do n't have legacy systems 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we did n't have landlines and we did n't need them 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we did n't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 today , we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than @entity110 and @entity111 put together 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 mobile money is another brilliant example 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 mobile money was created in @entity116 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the whole concept of having money on your phone , which is the best thing because it 's secure , it 's practical , made more sense 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 so , these kind of innovations , you 're going to see a lot more of on the continent 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent , and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they 're coming up with is just so inspiring 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who 's just starting out 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : entrepreneurship is a journey , it 's not a destination 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 there are going to be so many challenges , you are going to get knocked down so many times , but you 've got to get up , dust yourself off and get back to it 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the persistence , the passion , and staying on course is very crucial 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 you 'll be tempted to cut corners , you 'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker , but it never lasts 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we 're not 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 we 're the leaders of today , but it 's our responsibility to take the seat at the table 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : what needs to be done most urgently to grow @entity27 economies 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : @entity164 collaboration is extremely important 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 i think things like regional integration , inter-african trade does need to increase and is increasing 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 i mean , the progress in the @entity170 has been amazing 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the manner in which they 've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 so , we need to see more of that take place on the continent 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the fact that we 're 54 countries , yet we 're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 i think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : are you confident about the future of the continent 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : i am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership , the mindset of our leaders 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 it is so inspiring to see that 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 it 's unfortunate that , you know , globally the highlight remains things like @entity203 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 the little issues that we do have are just magnified , yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 @entity5 : is this @entity15 's century 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 at : @entity208 's logo is the @entity209 and our little joke , which a lot of people do n't appreciate , hence i love it even more , is that the @entity216 @entity215 and the @entity217 have had their days and it 's now the @entity209 's turn 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
 and it genuinely is -- this is our turn 	@entity9 @placeholder built a vast business empire
