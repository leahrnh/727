( @entity0 ) -- when a ' @entity3 ' roars , @entity1 listens 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 the @entity4 in @entity1 was enveloped by floating sand and dust on march 18 , 2008 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 these huge , sky - blackening dust storms sweep across @entity8 in march and april , bringing with them millions of tons of sand from inner @entity12 and depositing it in @entity14 and on across the @entity15 to @entity16 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 during the past few years the storms have grown in ferocity and scale , and they are at the vanguard of an advancing @entity22 desert that threatens more than 400 million people in the @entity14 provinces of @entity25 , @entity12 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 the economic toll has been estimated to cost the @entity14 economy $ 6	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
5 billion per year 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 but desertification is not limited to @entity14 and it is fast becoming a serious global problem that will only be exacerbated by climate change 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in the @entity14 provinces of @entity12 and @entity25 the causes are reasonably straightforward , and in many ways they area is an exemplar of the situation in developing countries worldwide 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 rapid population growth has put enormous pressure on agricultural systems that have been pushed towards unsustainable farming practices in order to cope with demand 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity14 livestock numbers have nearly doubled in the last 30 years , from around 200 million in the early 1970 's , to 427 million in 2002 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 as a result huge amount of marginal land has been taken in as pasture , overgrazed to the point of exhaustion , and now farmers are being forced to watch the topsoil literally blow away on the spring winds 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity58 demand for water has shrunk @entity60 by 95 percent since the 1960s , leaving only sand and scrub 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity64 desertification has meant that nearly 50 percent of cropland has been abandoned since 1980 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 the @entity66 is advancing into @entity67 and @entity68 at the rate of 3,510 square kilometers per year 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity71 , fierce sandstorms are believed to have buried more than 100 villages in 2002 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 but this is only expected to get worse 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 across the world climate change is set to exacerbate problems where poor land use and population pressure is already putting an immense strain on finely balanced ecologies 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 @entity58 may only be able to feed 25 percent of its population by 2025 , according to the @entity82 in @entity58 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 many countries in the @entity85 basin could face a future of significant food and water shortages as climate change bites and deserts spread 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 already desertification is estimated to cost @entity92 us $ 200 million per year 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 predicting the regional effect of climate change is always difficult , but some scientists are suggesting a four degrees rise in the @entity85 by 2100 , with an associated 10 percent to 40 percent drop in rainfall 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 a change on this scale would cause existing areas of desert to spread and exacerbate the problems associated with erosion , wildfires and the salinization of the water table 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 already water supplies in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 are at or close to 1,000 cubic meters per person per year , which is widely taken as a benchmark for water scarcity 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 globally crop yields are likely to fall substantially as the area of desert grows across @entity58 , the @entity124 , the @entity125 and @entity126 and this , coupled with associated rising prices for key crops such as maize and soybeans , could threaten food security in some countries 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 scientists also predict that water shortages could increase the risk of supply contamination and associated diseases such as cholera and dysentery 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 because desertification is often caused by population pressure , effective control is hard to achieve and many solutions are focused on dealing with the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 the @entity14 government is creating a forest belt stretching 2,800 miles ( 4,500 kilometers ) to block the advancing sands of the @entity22 desert and diminish the effect of the sandstorms 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 the @entity154 is seeking support to fund a similar " @entity156 " to hold back the @entity66 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity109 officials hope that the inauguration of the 250,000 hectare @entity159 will slow the advance of the sands 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 but for such schemes to work they will need to take account of local context and build what @entity166 , director of the @entity167 , calls " a mosaic of local innovations 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 " she cites the regeneration of trees around fields in central @entity174 , and the terraces for soil and water conservation in @entity178 as perfect examples 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 many ecologists argue that it is small , simple , localized changes towards more sustainable patterns of land - use that will offer effective long - term solutions 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 for example , in many areas of the world the search for fuel for cooking fires puts enormous strain on the landscape : as trees are cut down , erosion increases and deserts spread 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 but the shift towards using cheap , fuel - efficient ' rocket stoves ' and solar cookers could cut the amount of wood needed dramatically 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 leguminous plants , such as beans , which ' fix ' nitrogen from the air can be used to help restore fertility in already damaged areas 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 belts of trees and grass can be used to reduce wind velocity and stop sand spreading , and provide a managed resource for local communities 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 in @entity92 , @entity214 , an organization that " aims to develop , demonstrate and communicate accessible , low - tech methods of sustainable living in a semi arid environment " has had enormous success renovating abandoned 1,000 - year old @entity220 irrigation systems 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 they believe that similar systems , alongside " appropriate technology " such as solar heaters and biogas producers , may offer a way to slow desertification in many other countries 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
 what is becoming clearer year - by - year is that we ca n't fight the advancing desert - only by looking after the land can we expect it to look after us 	dust storms affect 400 million people in @placeholder each year
