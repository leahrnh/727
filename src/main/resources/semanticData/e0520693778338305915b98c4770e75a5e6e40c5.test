( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the last of six women programmers who debugged and operated the earliest general - purpose computer , has died 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines

 @entity1 was profiled in a @entity0 story last month about women mathematicians who were recruited by the @entity16 military to do ballistics research during @entity18 and five of her fellow " computers " went on to program the @entity21 , but they did n't receive recognition for their work until years later 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
 " @entity1 is probably one of the most significant pioneers in computing , " @entity6 said 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
 " @entity1 worked hard and , as a woman in a man 's world at that time , especially in the business world , it 's amazing what she was able to accomplish 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines

 she recalled living on her parents ' farm , refusing the teaching jobs her father suggested and avoiding all talk of marrying a farmer and having babies 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
 instead , she took a train to @entity42 to work for the military 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
 there , she learned ballistics calculations and was quickly hired to work on the @entity21 , created during the war by @entity47 scientists @entity48 and @entity50 @entity1 and her colleagues debugged the computer , which weighed 30 tons , contained about 18,000 vacuum tubes and completed the same work the women " computers " did but in a fraction of the time 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines

 @entity1 and the other @entity21 programmers did n't receive much attention for their work after @entity69 , but their story was recently featured in the documentary " @entity73 @entity72 : the @entity75 of @entity74 wrote an autobiography that is being edited ; @entity6 said he hopes it will be published this year 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
 in 1997 , @entity1 was inducted into the @entity78 , along with her fellow @entity21 programmers , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 	@placeholder went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and univac machines
