( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 never stops surprising us 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 every corner of the planet offers some sort of natural peculiarity with an explanation that makes us wish we 'd studied harder in junior high @entity1 science class 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 some of these sites are challenging to get to ; others are busy tourist destinations 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 they keep natural scientists searching for answers and the rest of us astounded by the secrets and mysteries the world continues to reveal 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity20 , @entity21 most people wo n't see @entity20 in person , but even in photographs , the sight is arresting : a blood - red waterfall staining the snow - white face of @entity28 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the place was documented in 1911 by geographer / geologist @entity30 , a member of @entity33 's ill - fated expedition to the @entity21 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 ( @entity33 named the glacier for @entity30 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 ) 8 very old sites in the @entity36 since then , glaciologists and microbiologists have sought to determine what causes the mysterious red flow 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 they 've concluded that the source is a subterranean lake rich in the iron that gives the water its red hue 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 stranger still , recent research has revealed microorganisms living 1,300 feet beneath the ice , sustained by the iron and sulfur in the water 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 what could possibly cause an automobile to roll backward uphill without power 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 a magnetic force from within the @entity1 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 something even more fantastic 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 since the 1930s , when the phenomenon of @entity51 was discovered ( and almost immediately promoted as a tourist attraction ) , people have been trying to figure out its riddle 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 even though it 's been demonstrated that the " magnetic force " is an optical illusion and the uphill slope is actually a downhill slope , that has n't stopped carloads of travelers from visiting @entity51 and testing it for themselves 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 digging deep : 15 ancient ruins you might not know @entity74 , @entity75 when people try to convince you there 's nothing new under the sun , direct them to the @entity75 island of @entity74 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 before 1963 , it did n't exist 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 then , an underwater volcano in the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) erupted , and when the activity settled down in 1967 , what remained was an island where no island had been before 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 at its largest , @entity74 measured about 1 square mile , but wind and water have eroded the volcanic matter to a little more than half that size 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 presented with this unsullied environment , the @entity75 government determined that the best thing to do was preserve it 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 thus , although you can sail past it on a @entity84 day cruise , @entity74 remains off - limits to just about everyone except marine biologists , geologists , botanists and other scientists conducting research there 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 8 elegant @entity110 mansion hotels @entity111 , @entity112 large spherical boulders -- some measuring 12 feet in circumference -- are scattered on @entity115 on the east coast of @entity112 's @entity117 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 they formed millions of years ago on the ancient sea floor , collecting and hardening sediment and minerals around a core such as a fossil or a shell similar to the way oysters form pearls 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 they 're not the world 's only examples of what geologists call septarian concretions 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 you can also visit the @entity135 near @entity136 on the northwestern coast of @entity112 's @entity138 , for example 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 yet the @entity111 are some of the world 's largest 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the particulars of their origin and what caused the distinctive cracks inside them are still being studied 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 midnight sun , @entity148 , @entity149 from april 20 to august 23 , the sun never sets over @entity151 , a @entity149 archipelago that lies north of @entity152 in the @entity153 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the phenomenon plays havoc with everyone 's body clocks 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 is it noon 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 is it midnight 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 after a day or two , it 's hard to tell 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 among the northernmost yet still - accessible places to experience the midnight sun is @entity148 , the largest island in the group 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the island is well - suited and accommodating to travelers , who tend to keep strange hours in summer and who soon understand why their hotel rooms have been fitted with darkening curtains 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity171 , @entity172 what appears to be a @entity175 - style snowy landscape in southwestern @entity172 is actually the result of calcium carbonate deposits from 17 natural hot springs accumulating over thousands of years 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 beginning in the late second century @entity181 , this area near present - day @entity180 was a destination for those who sought the therapeutic benefits of the mineral - rich water whose temperature reaches upward of 100 degrees @entity187 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 today , you can see remnants of the baths at the ancient holy city of @entity192 , but it 's the stunning terraces , cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of @entity171 -- @entity172 for " @entity197 " -- that give it remarkable natural beauty 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 how ordinary stones manage to " sail " over the surface of @entity200 in @entity201 is a mystery people have tried to solve since 1915 , when a prospector and his wife noticed tracks that seemed to indicate that the stones had somehow traveled across the dry earth 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 short of cosmic intervention , the stones required terrestrial forces to move them 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 but what forces 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the current prevailing theory about the " sailing stones " of @entity200 , presented by a team of physicists in 2011 , involves ice that forms around the stones , causing them to move and to leave a trail in their wake 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 many visitors still hope for a more mystical explanation 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 behind the cascade of a small waterfall in the @entity232 section of @entity233 in suburban @entity234 , @entity227 , you might see what appears to be an optical illusion : a flickering golden flame 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 actually , you 'll smell it before you see it , and amazingly , it 's real , fueled by what geologists call a macroseep of natural gas from the @entity1 below 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 a geological fault in the shale allows about 1 kilogram of methane gas per day to escape to the surface , where , at some point , possibly the early 20th century , a visitor had the idea to set it alight 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the water occasionally extinguishes the flame , but there 's always another hiker with a lighter to reignite it 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 @entity259 claims the highest concentration of geysers of any place on @entity1 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 geysers are hot springs with plumbing challenges that result in eruptions 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 more than 300 can be found throughout the park 's 3,472 square miles , and none is more famous than @entity258 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 in fact , @entity258 is the reason @entity259 was designated a @entity201 -- the first in the @entity110 -- in 1872 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 its name comes from the perceived regularity of its eruptions , which occur every 55 to 120 minutes and last for two to five minutes 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the spectacular eruptions remain a source of fascination for the more than 3	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
5 million people who visit @entity259 each year 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 the fact that the eruptions are n't quite as regular as they might seem -- and that the mean eruption interval seems to be lengthening -- keeps geologists fascinated , too 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 thanks to its humidity , its elevation and the clash of winds from the mountains and the sea , the southwestern corner of @entity288 in @entity286 has the world 's highest frequency of lightning activity ( 250 flashes per square kilometer per year ) 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 more than 200 nights per year , with peaks in may and october , lightning flashes fill the sky -- sometimes 25 or more flashes per minute 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 to put that in perspective : the @entity308 classifies anything over 12 strikes per minute as " excessive 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
 " named for the @entity311 , which flows from @entity312 in to @entity288 , the @entity313 , or @entity314 , has become a highlight for travelers who spend their nights wide awake and wide - eyed watching the spectacle 	the @placeholder in @entity112 are what geologists call septarian concretions
