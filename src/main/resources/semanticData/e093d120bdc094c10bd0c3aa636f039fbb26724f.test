@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- investigators trying to figure out what caused wednesday 's massive bridge collapse are focusing on the southern end of the span , which " behaved differently " as it fell , the @entity3 said friday 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the @entity3 says one part of the bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell , while other sections collapsed in place 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the @entity3 , which is investigating the disaster that killed at least five people and injured dozens , is also hoping another video provided by the @entity17 will provide new images of the collapse 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 what 's getting investigators ' attention is the way the southern part of the bridge fell in a video they 've already examined -- recorded by a security camera near the bridge 's north end -- and the way the section settled after the collapse 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " it appears that it has shifted approximately 50 feet to the east and when we compare that to what we 've seen in the rest of the bridge -- the rest of the bridge appears to have collapsed in place , " said @entity3 chairman @entity34 , who is leading a 19 - member team charged with determining the cause of the accident 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " we 're going to take a look at any unique design factors that could have created that shift 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 for whatever reason 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " it 's not the answer to the mystery of why the bridge fell , but a step forward , @entity34 said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the @entity3 will also examine three more videos provided by the @entity17 , one of which may show another view of the bridge falling , @entity34 said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 investigators are n't optimistic the other two will show anything because they were n't pointed at the bridge 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 on thursday , @entity66 transportation secretary @entity65 notified state transportation departments to immediately inspect all bridges of the same design as the one that collapsed wednesday on @entity72 into the @entity73 in @entity0 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 @entity74 , spokesman for the @entity75 , said there are about 750 bridges across the country that have similar steel deck truss designs 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 @entity74 said the measure is being taken " out of extreme caution 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " two reports published since 2001 have pointed to structural problems with the @entity72 bridge , but both reports determined the bridge was safe despite deficiencies 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 see which states have most troubled bridges » " the bridge 's deck truss system has not experienced fatigue cracking , but it has many poor fatigue details on the main truss and the floor truss system , " said a report conducted for the @entity91 in 2001 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the 40 - year - old bridge is of a type known as deck steel truss 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 it has three parts : a deck , superstructure and substructure 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the deck is made of concrete and rebar , the superstructure is made of steel and the substructure is made of steel and concrete footing , according to @entity34 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the executive summary of the 2001 @entity91 report -- undertaken by the @entity117 's @entity116 -- points to fatigue problems with the bridge 's approach span , the segments that connect the main span of the bridge to land 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 however , the report said , " fatigue cracking is not expected during the remaining useful life of the bridge 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " watch the bridge collapse » in 2005 , the @entity66 @entity91 's @entity131 database concluded the bridge was " structurally deficient 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " @entity91 bridge engineer @entity133 said the term " structurally deficient " is a @entity136 rating 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 inspectors rate sections of the bridge on a 1 to 9 scale , with 9 being in excellent condition , he said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " a structurally deficient condition is a bridge that would have a rating of 4 either in the deck , the superstructure or the substructure , " he said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " any one of those in condition 4 or less is considered structurally deficient 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " but , he noted , out of 13,000 state and local bridges in @entity1 that are 20 feet and more in span , 1,160 of them -- 8 percent of the state 's bridges -- are considered structurally deficient 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 @entity156 of the @entity136 's @entity157 said the structurally deficient rating was a " programatic classification rather than an indication of safety 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " " it does not indicate a bridge is dangerous or that that bridge must be replaced , " he said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the @entity1 bridge was deemed structurally deficient in 1990 , @entity133 said , " due to corrosion of the bearings , so they were not able to move as freely as designed 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " later , inspectors found corrosion of steel around joints in the bridge and fatigue cracks in the approach spans 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 those problems were repaired in the 1990s 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " recent inspections in 2005 and 2006 found no evidence of cracking or growth in the existing cracks in the tab well that have been there since the day the bridge was built , " he said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 @entity133 also cited an in - depth study of the bridge 's fatigue potential conducted from 2004 to 2007 that recommended two alternatives for the bridge 's future -- to add steel plates to reinforce critical parts of the bridge or to conduct thorough inspections of the wells inside the box to determine whether there were cracks 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " we chose the inspection route , and began in may , " he said , adding that officials intended to replace the bridge about 2020 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " we had the bridge partially inspected and were going to complete that this fall after construction was done 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 " during a wednesday news conference , @entity1 gov	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 @entity204 described the bridge deficiencies as " minor " and said the state was told that the bridge 's deck might need to be rehabilitated or replaced in 2020 or later 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 view photos from the disaster » " it was last inspected both in 2005 and 2006 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 there were no structural deficiencies identified according to [ the @entity91 ] , " @entity204 said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 most bridges are inspected every two years and receive ratings based on the conditions of various components , according to the @entity66 @entity91 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 in addition to " structurally deficient , " another bridge classification is " functionally obsolete , " according to the @entity136 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 a bridge is tagged structurally deficient when significant bridge elements have deteriorated and the bridge 's load - carrying capacity is reduced , according to the highway administration 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 a bridge is dubbed functionally obsolete when the bridge does not meet current design standards 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 neither label indicates a bridge is unsafe for travel , the highway administration said 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 as of 2003 , there were about 160,570 bridges deemed structurally deficient or functionally obsolete , according to the @entity236 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
 the number represented 27	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
1 percent of the nation 's bridges 	new : @placeholder says one section of bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell
