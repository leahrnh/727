( @entity1 ) if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users , would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 the answer , of course , would be no	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 yet for decades , many have stood by the belief that such programs , known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs , promote and encourage drug use 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 indeed , for @entity17 , it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 but an overwhelming body of scientific evidence continues to show that this is simply not true 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 as a result of the recent spikes in @entity28 and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural @entity31 and @entity32 , the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 and this time , scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two blood - borne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 this is a welcome step -- an estimated 50,000 @entity43 are newly infected with @entity28 every year , and some 8 % are among injection drug users 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 meanwhile , between 2006 and 2012 , at least 30 states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates , with more than half reporting at least a 200 % increase in acute infections among young adults 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 overall , the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under 30 rose from 36 % to 49 % in six years 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 with such numbers in mind , the recent national spotlight on syringe services programs offers a critical opportunity for us to reignite a much - needed conversation 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against @entity28 and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes -- without increasing drug use 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 in addition to helping curb the spread of these diseases by offering access to sterile syringes , these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets and protecting law enforcement personnel and others , including children , from injuries 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 they also offer preventive health services , such as hiv testing and counseling , and form vital bridges to drug treatment , overdose prevention , housing and employment services 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 for states such as @entity96 and @entity97 -- early adopters of these interventions -- syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down @entity28 transmission among injecting drug users 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 @entity97 was the first state in the @entity43 to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in @entity105 in 1988 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 in @entity107 -- where half of all injection drug users were @entity28 positive in the 1980s -- state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in 1992 to combat the disease , deeming it a " public health necessity 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 " the expansion of these programs in @entity96 was followed by a dramatic reduction in @entity28 incidence among injecting drug users , declining from 54 % in 1990 to 13 % in 2001 ; hepatitis c prevalence declined from 90 % to 63 % during this period 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 because they work , syringe services programs will likely be an integral part of the statewide plans announced by @entity96 gov	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 @entity123 and @entity97 gov	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 @entity124 to reduce new hiv infections dramatically by 2020 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 syringe exchange programs not only save lives , but also save millions of dollars in @entity28 treatment costs 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 while a clean syringe costs less than 50 cents , the average lifetime cost of treating an hiv - positive person is estimated to be around $ 425,000 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 as hiv - positive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness , public programs such as @entity133 will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 for example , an analysis by @entity141 researchers showed that expanding the availability of syringe services programs to cover just 10 % of all injections in the @entity43 would prevent almost 500 new hiv infections among drug users per year 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 this translates into $ 193 million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated $ 64 million investment 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 in other words , every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between $ 3 and $ 7 in @entity28 treatment costs alone 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 despite such evidence , syringe services programs are continually caught in the political crossfire 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 a longstanding ban , temporarily lifted in 2009 and then reinstated by @entity17 as part of 2010 budget negotiations , prevents state and local jurisdictions from spending their federal health dollars on these programs 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 lifting the ban will not cost any additional money -- it simply allows states to spend their federally allocated dollars on syringe services programs , if they choose to do so 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 why is this important 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 the federal government provides the majority of funding for all hiv prevention services 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 without access to federal funding , more than 200 syringe service programs in 34 states , @entity177 , and @entity178 are operating on shoestring budgets from local and state governments 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 this has forced syringe services programs across the country to cut staff , scale down services and potentially shut their doors for good 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 meanwhile , the new @entity28 and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in primarily rural states , such as in @entity31 or @entity32 , show that the landscape of injection drug use in @entity43 is rapidly changing 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 we have a chance right now to get ahead of the curve and avert a nationwide resurgence of @entity28 and hepatitis c infections through injection drug use 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
 it is time for @entity17 to make sound and effective policy based upon facts rather than discredited assertions or unsubstantiated fears 	@entity210 @entity209 : syringe exchange programs save millions in @placeholder treatment costs
