@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- in what may be the furthest thing from a pleasure cruise , the @entity4 's only operating @entity3 icebreaker is escorting a @entity9 - flagged tanker this week on an emergency fuel run to the ice - blocked town of @entity13 , @entity14 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the mission : deliver 1	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
1 million gallons of diesel fuel and 300,000 gallons of gasoline to @entity13 ( population 3,598 ) , where storms prevented a fuel shipment in the fall 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity24 , the two ships left @entity25 , in @entity14 's @entity26 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 friday , the ships are expected to encounter the ice , and @entity29 will take the lead , plowing a 300 - mile - long path for the @entity9 - flagged tanker @entity33 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 if all goes well , the two ships will arrive at @entity13 on sunday or monday 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the @entity34 will stop a half mile short of the harbor to avoid scraping the bottom , while the tanker @entity39 will push on , stopping next to stable ice to off - load fuel using a lengthy hoses 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 officials are calling the trip historic 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 it is the first time fuel has been delivered through ice - covered waters to a western @entity14 community , they say 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 while it is possible to exaggerate @entity13 's plight -- fuel could have been flown in -- officials say it is difficult to exaggerate what this mission says about the dismal status of the @entity4 's ice - breaking fleet 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the nation 's two heavy polar icebreakers -- the @entity58 and the @entity59 -- are out of commission , with the @entity59 unlikely to see service again 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the 420 - foot @entity34 , meanwhile , is a medium - sized icebreaker and it does not have the capabilities of its larger predecessors 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the @entity13 mission has lengthened the eight - month deployment of its 80 - person crew , robbing them of a @entity72 holiday 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 and it is delaying scheduled repairs to the ship , possibly affecting its scientific mission scheduled for next summer 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 this further underscores just how thin the nation 's ice - breaking capabilities have become 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 by contrast , @entity9 has 25 polar icebreakers ( including eight heavy ones ) , according to a @entity85 report 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity86 and @entity87 have seven icebreakers each 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity89 has six 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " the @entity91 needs icebreakers , and this incident proves it , " said @entity14 's lt	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 gov	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity90 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity90 said the dearth of icebreakers means the @entity91 is not competitive with other @entity3 nations , which are exploiting new water passages created by climate changes 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 icebreakers could extend the seasons for some state industries , he said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 but many people in the @entity101 just do n't understand , @entity90 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " the @entity91 has been an @entity3 nation since 1867 , but most people still think of @entity14 as @entity103 , " he said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the @entity13 mission " brings awareness that there is a bigger issue there , " said @entity13 mayor @entity104 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " it really does 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " " there is more of a need now than ever before in our history for new ice - breaking ships capable of reaching the shores of our communities , " wrote @entity111 , chairman of @entity112 , @entity13 's village corporation 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 slow - motion crisis if the @entity13 situation is a crisis , it 's a " crisis that 's kind of unfolding in slow motion , " @entity111 told @entity1 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the stage was set in november when a major storm swept through the region , delaying a barge carrying 1	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
6 million gallons of fuel to @entity13 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 after the storm cleared , sea ice blocked the harbor 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the village corporation , one of two main suppliers of fuel for the town , quickly determined its existing fuel would likely run out before another barge could reach the town in the spring 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 there was a chance that home heating fuel would run out by march , when @entity13 is still subject to freezing temperatures 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 diesel fuel for the police department and heavy equipment ran out a week ago , though the town 's other supplier has helped fill that void 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 and gasoline is expected to run out in early february , @entity111 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 corporation officials considered flying in fuel 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 but it would have taken more than 300 flights , each carrying 4,000 to 5,000 gallons , to meet the town 's needs , @entity111 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 shipping costs would have added $ 3 or $ 4 to the price of a gallon of gasoline , which already approaches $ 6 a gallon , he said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the corporation considered hiring local ice - breaking tugs , @entity89 tugs and barges , @entity169 ice - breaking ships and @entity9 ships , finally settling on @entity9 ships that were " close , capable and possibly available 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " @entity172 contracted with the @entity33 , a @entity9 - flagged , double - hulled vessel 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 since the @entity39 is an ice - breaking tanker , " we were confident , cautiously confident , that they could do it unassisted , " @entity111 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 but @entity111 said he sought assistance from the @entity4 icebreaker to ensure the mission 's success 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " this has never been done before and when you do something that 's never been done before , having an organization like the @entity4 is a huge relief , " @entity111 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 officials said legal and regulatory obstacles were as formidable as the ice 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity111 and officials worked with the @entity4 to get a waiver from the @entity190 , which requires goods being transported from one @entity91 port to another to be transported by a @entity91 - flagged ship 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 the @entity4 inspected the @entity39 so it could operate in @entity91 waters 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 and they worked out a plan to off - load the fuel at @entity13 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 state officials invoked a law signed by president @entity200 that allows the @entity4 to conduct operations for commercial enterprises 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 though commonly used to justify @entity4 operations in the @entity206 and @entity207 , it had not previously been used to assist businesses in @entity14 , officials said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " the same protections that @entity91 enjoy in the @entity206 , western @entity14 ought to enjoy , " @entity90 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 to the rescue rear adm	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 @entity211 , commander of the @entity4 's district that includes @entity14 , said the @entity4 had wanted to be part of the operation from the beginning 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " clearly having @entity34 there in the event that something were to ( go wrong ) , just a simple mechanical problem on @entity33 , the @entity34 's there to help her out , " @entity211 said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " it 's a 300 - mile transit in ice close to our shores and the prudent thing to do 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " @entity211 said the @entity34 can cut through " first year " ice at close to 10 knots , but that the speed of the @entity39 may be the limiting factor 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 he said he is confident that mission will be successful 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " we 're not relying on hope or chance here 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 we 've spent a lot of time with all of our partners , whether that 's state , federal , tribal partners , as well as the city of @entity13 , to ensure that we look at all of the details of how this operation is going to go down , " he said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " i think we 're going to do fine on this 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " village corporation chairman @entity111 agreed 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
 " i 've done everything but celebrate yet , " he said 	@placeholder 's only @entity3 icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to @entity13
