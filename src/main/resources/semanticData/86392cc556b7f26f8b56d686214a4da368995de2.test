( @entity1 ) @entity0 have a saying : " too much of something cripples it 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 " we 're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches , medieval castles and @entity8 ruins that we simply do n't know what to do with them , let alone care for a proper upkeep 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 we 've turned blind to their value and beauty 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 there are nearly 5,000 " gems " scattered across the country , ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 @entity0 boasts the highest number of @entity23 in the world -- 50 , several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 and there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides , floods and natural calamities 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the @entity37 - listed @entity36 of @entity38 , where @entity40 ' tomb lies , is just the last of a series of national shames 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 its frescoed walls by @entity46 masters including @entity48 risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 in a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 we 're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 i remember once an @entity62 colleague asking me : " but what does @entity0 do with its immense cultural heritage " 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 good question 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 if other nations had half as much of what we boast , they 'd make a much better job with it 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 paradoxically , if we had just the @entity73 or @entity74 it would be easier 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 but we do n't and trouble is @entity0 does n't know how to exploit this treasure 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 take the @entity78 's successful exhibition on @entity79 in 2013 : we have the real site in our backyard but the @entity82 made the best of it worldwide while the real @entity79 was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 or , worse , @entity0 could n't care less to promote its assets 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 as a travel writer i have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it 's a battle : many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 i find myself almost begging them , when it should be the other way round 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the true but sad thing is that restyling in @entity0 is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 @entity103 has already saved @entity105 's @entity104 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the @entity73 is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand @entity107 , while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 yet it 's not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity - driven measures 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 it 's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment , the care to cherish a country 's valuable monuments 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 and that 's because @entity0 have always lacked a sense of national belonging : @entity0 , despite its millenary history , is one of the world 's most modern states , unified in 1861 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 @entity131 @entity130 once said : " now that we 've made @entity0 , we need to make @entity0 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 " tough job indeed , and we 're still a long way to go 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 there 's also wide - spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 heritage authorities are in love with the romantic ideal " of decadent ruins " : better leave the monument or site as it is , even allow it to rot , rather than recover it and " destroy its original beauty 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 " each time new subway works bring to light an unknown @entity8 theatre or necropoli , it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 but that 's a blind approach 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 there 's so much @entity0 could do with what it has , that it could live off tourism 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 @entity158 estimates that culture and art , if well exploited , could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year , amounting to 15	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
3 % of gdp 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 another thorny issue is having a cheap culture 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 entrance tickets to the @entity73 , @entity0 's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists , cost a maximum of 12 euros 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 @entity170 's rock crypts are 5 euros 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 not to mention churches featuring @entity173 's works , which are free to enter 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the first time i visited @entity176 in @entity177 , and @entity178 in @entity179 , i was shocked to find out i had to pay to get in 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 and it was quite expensive , too 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 one could argue that @entity0 does well to open for free the @entity183 's doors , but probably in some " critical " cases a minimum cost to enter would n't hurt 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the country 's mindset needs to change , too 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 monuments and works of art are not dead , but living things that deserve to be sexed - up once in a while 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 if we do n't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance , why not give them over to other countries to run 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 or sell them to rich businessmen 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 similar options make state authorities ' hair stand on end : they stress art belongs to the @entity0 people and should remain in public hands -- even if it 's inaccessible and unenjoyable 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private , thriving multimedia museum 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the @entity215 ' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces , which could be leased out to privates 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 but cobwebs and dust can do no harm , right 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 our sunny piazzas , bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities ' coffers 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 and who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 there are also 6,000 abandoned medieval " ghost towns " that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 the state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out , one being a @entity46 villa in @entity253 turned into a deluxe spa resort 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 fine , @entity255 was n't built in a day 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
 but it could crumble in an hour 	@entity0 boasts the highest number of @placeholder in the world
