 @entity2 : tell me about the woman who inspired your work 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity72 : i grew up with a girl named @entity74 who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 and it was scary 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 you just want to be there to watch them grow up 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 paying the bills , cleaning her home , making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 i wanted to make things as easy as possible for her 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 so when i would go to the store , i 'd grab an extra @entity94 and extra toilet paper 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 when i would make my meals for my family , i would double it and bring a meal over to her house 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder

 i just tried to do those little things that i hoped would relieve her of some stress 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 about six months after she passed , we got to thinking she could n't have been the only one 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 there were other people like her that needed help 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 and that 's how @entity32 was born 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity2 : i 'd imagine that many people have n't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 how are you able to help 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity72 : we focus on day - to - day support -- financial assistance , housecleaning , prepared meals , supplies for the home , kids ' events 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 it 's that old - fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 who does n't like a clean house that they did n't have to clean themselves 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 we have a team of volunteers that have all been background - checked and they sweep , mop , clean the bathrooms 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 and so , our parents can come home from chemo , sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about , " ugh , the bathroom needs to be cleaned 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 " it 's just to allow them to focus on what 's important , which is their health and their family 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity2 : is this work hard for you sometimes , on a personal level 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity72 : about 80 % of the parents we support are stage 4 , which means that battling cancer is their full - time job 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives , they 'll be in treatment 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 it 's hard 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder

 " but then i come back and remember why 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 and so , while @entity74 is and always will be our inspiration , there are now so many others that are just as inspirational 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 they 're why i keep doing what i do 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity2 : we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity72 : we 're not just about moms -- we have dads , too 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 not a lot , but if you are a single parent , you need the support 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 they tend to even get a little special treatment 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 everybody 's like , " oh , there 's a dad here 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 " and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity2 : it 's such a serious subject , but your group seems to have a very fun vibe 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 @entity72 : we 're very social 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 once a month , all of our families come to pick up their supplies 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 we do crafts with the kids , snacks and have a good time 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 we like having any event because cancer sucks , and there 's not a lot of happy that goes with that 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 but life does still go on , so it 's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 no one can understand what they 're going through like another single parent with cancer 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 cancer can be so defeating 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 it 's an ugly word and it 's a sad word 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 and so , it 's my hope that @entity32 can bring joy and say to cancer , " you ca n't defeat us 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
 we are still going to be strong and we 're going to celebrate life 	do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2015 @placeholder
