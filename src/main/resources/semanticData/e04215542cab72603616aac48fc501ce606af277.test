@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- it 's not just about the website anymore 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 @entity5 foes of @entity6 still use words like " disaster " and " epic " failure in describing the problems with @entity11 , the portal for enrolling in president @entity14 's signature health care reforms 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 however , they also concede the technology problems will likely get resolved , as promised again wednesday by @entity18 secretary @entity17 at a @entity20 hearing 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 the broader @entity5 focus is on their dislike for the @entity6 , passed in 2010 with no @entity5 support and upheld last year by the @entity25 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 at wednesday 's hearing , @entity5 accused @entity14 of lying to the @entity28 people in selling the reforms and railed against the impacts , including individual policyholders getting cancellation notices and premium prices rising in some areas 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 @entity14 's oft - repeated pledge that people could keep coverage they liked was " simply untrue , " said @entity5 sen	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder

 @entity50 of @entity51 pushed @entity17 on whether @entity14 's statement was true or false , she repeated the administration 's response that a grandfather clause included in the legislation allows people to keep policies that were in place before the law was signed more than three years ago 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 the matter involves a relatively small segment of the insurance market -- the 5 % of @entity28 who buy individual policies , unlike the vast majority who get their coverage through their jobs or government programs such as @entity71 , @entity72 and others 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 while only a sliver of the overall market , it still involves 12 million people , including more than 1 million who have received letters from their insurers telling them current policies are being discontinued 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 @entity17 said wednesday that the goal of the health care reforms known as @entity6 was to ensure everyone has minimum standards of coverage , which did n't exist in the individual market before the reforms 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 she said @entity14 's pledge that people can keep policies they liked -- which @entity40 and @entity50 noted remained on the @entity93 website on wednesday -- was mostly in reference to the 80 % of @entity28 getting coverage from employer and federal programs , as well as some in the individual markets 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 @entity14 further alters ' you can keep your plan ' pledge that was insufficient for @entity40 , who questioned why no one had lost their job so far over the botched website launch on october 1 or false statements by administration officials on people losing health coverage 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder

 back in @entity0 , @entity40 asked @entity17 if the thousands of navigators had been properly screened 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 @entity17 said a background check was not required for navigators on the federal exchange , noting such screening also was n't federally required for insurance agents 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder

 asked how many people had enrolled so far , @entity17 repeated that figures for the first month would be made public next week and that they would be less than originally anticipated because of the website problems that hindered the ability of large numbers to sign up 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
 " our early enrollment numbers are going to be very low , " she said 	new : " we are working overtime to get this fixed , " says the president in @placeholder
