( @entity1 ) it lays claim to being the most isolated human settlement on earth , a volcanic archipelago in the @entity6 , home to just under 270 people 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 now , the tiny settlement of @entity9 is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 with the help of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , the @entity16 overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self - sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 as a sign of just how removed @entity9 is from the rest of the world , there are only seven family names on the islands 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 those who live there are mainly the descendants of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 sailors as well as 19th century @entity16 explorers 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 there are also a handful of expatriate brits 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 but watching hit tv series " lost " or reading up on @entity44 's " @entity43 " wo n't be required research for competition entrants 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 instead , those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions , modern housing and developing cost - effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " the competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island ( and ) making all structures more energy efficient , " the island 's administrator , @entity53 told @entity1 when visiting the @entity16 recently 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 @entity53 explained that most existing homes and public buildings on @entity9 are small , bungalow - type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the island is also only accessible by sea 60 - days - a - year through a small port in its only town , @entity76 of the @entity77 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 according to @entity79 of @entity80 , contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as " how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " " there are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans - shipped , " he added 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 in total , @entity9 is made up of four islands 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 @entity9 is the largest land mass and the only one to house people 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 two more unpopulated islands , @entity96 and @entity97 , lie close by 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 a third , @entity99 , is situated roughly 230 miles away 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 both @entity99 and @entity97 are @entity100 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the closest mainland port is @entity102 , @entity103 , some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north - east 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 @entity9 already has a pub , shop , cafe , dance hall , museum , catholic church and swimming pool 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 there are also two expatriate doctors , two @entity9 nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the island 's main industry is lobster fishing , with exports reaching as far afield as the @entity34 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 @entity9 earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps , coins and handicraft souvenirs , @entity53 explained 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " as it is the remotest inhabited island in the world , the @entity9 are already very self sufficient , being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs ( like fish , livestock and potatoes ) , " @entity53 said 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 however , the cost of living has increased in recent years , he added 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 with limited transport and communication links , the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels , improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " we are slowly updating 40 - year old infrastructure , " @entity53 said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 that modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 before that period , the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by @entity162 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 things have already changed a lot since then , however 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " a new water system , electrical system and waste water system have just been completed , " @entity53 said 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " and with the 200th anniversary of the founding of @entity9 ( 2016 ) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 " interested architects have until mid-june to submit their initial ideas 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between june and september 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 @entity79 and @entity53 say the islanders will have to apply to the @entity16 and possibly the @entity124 for grants to fund the project 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the winner is penciled in to be announced in june 2016 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 the most important aspect for applicants is to " identify cost - effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency ( through renewable energy sources ) of properties , " @entity53 said " as well as modernizing 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
 government structures 	@placeholder holds competition for architects and designers
