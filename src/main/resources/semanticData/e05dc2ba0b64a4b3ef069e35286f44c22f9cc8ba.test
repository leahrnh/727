 but @entity1 could not turn their dominance into further goals , and @entity5 should have leveled just before halftime when @entity52 defender @entity51 was sent off as his nudge in the back of @entity55 saw the @entity57 striker tumble in the box 	@entity1 climb to top of @entity3 with 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 rivals @placeholder

 @entity1 captain @entity68 made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82 , as @entity75 defender @entity74 paid the price for deliberately blocking the @entity79 midfielder 's clever little flick with his arm 	@entity1 climb to top of @entity3 with 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 rivals @placeholder
 @entity81 consolidated fourth place with a hard - fought 2 - 1 victory at 10 - man @entity84 , as substitute @entity86 came off the bench to put the @entity6 club ahead before @entity89 was sent off and then helped set up @entity91 's 77th - minute winner 	@entity1 climb to top of @entity3 with 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 rivals @placeholder
