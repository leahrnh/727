 they are but improved means to an unimproved end 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 " - @entity8 the march on @entity9 in 1963 was a day for great speeches 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 of course , no one knew that the day would also include one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century , @entity15 " oration ( actually titled , " normalcy no more " ) 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 in fact , @entity17 's adviser and draft speechwriter , @entity19 , says that with everyone consumed by march logistics , the speech was not their highest priority , and hours before the event while @entity17 was considering a theme for his speech he did n't know exactly what he would say 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 @entity30 , the triumph of procrastination 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 it was a different time , a time when politicians like @entity35 and preachers like @entity17 made efforts to craft big ideas in beautiful language 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 it was the age of thriving newspapers and bookstores 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 back then , audiences listened expectantly for the art of rhetoric 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 they demanded that speakers respect them enough to put real effort and poetry into their publicly spoken words 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 and , they listened without the pressure and distraction of multitasking on mobile devices 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 they listened patiently , even while sweating profusely in the august heat 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 what about today , in the age of social media 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 would @entity17 be an active social media communicator 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 and , a more important question : how well would @entity17 's gift for rhetoric translate over social networks 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 opinion : 50 years later , civil rights struggle is far from over the answer to both questions is positive 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 as a public theologian he had an encyclopedic knowledge of political writings and literature 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 he had an amazing ability to educate , inspire and mobilize people through language and speech 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 he would have recognized that social media is the public square of the 21st century 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 a keen communicator could not afford to be silent in this space 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 according to @entity17 's advisers , @entity19 and @entity81 , @entity15 would have utilized @entity82 and other social media 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 @entity19 says , " he would be up all hours of the night telling me and @entity84 his thoughts and we would have learned to send tweets 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 " it 's worth noting that during the mid- 1950s , @entity17 ( most likely assisted by a staff member ) responded to readers ' letters in his " @entity92 " column in @entity94 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 he did this in order to communicate with a more diverse audience through popular media 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 he discontinued the responses after his life became too busy and his doctor recommended a slower pace following his 1958 stabbing 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 as a man who both loved people and loved to talk , he would have a large social media footprint 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 as for the second question , could @entity17 be @entity17 via @entity82 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 the real taste test is found in the actual language he used to educate and inspire 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 and , surprisingly , much of it fits within the most constraining of social media platforms , the 140 character limit of @entity82 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator

 ok , he 'd have to split that one into a quartet of tweets 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 @entity17 's instincts for youth culture were strong and , if alive today , he would be a prominent commentator with a vast social network of followers and friends 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 this would be an easy way to engage in meaningful dialogue with millennials and @entity191 , particularly important since researchers report that younger people do not attend traditional houses of worship at near the rate of their parents 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator

 @entity17 , everybody in and nobody out seeking to engage youth , he taught a course at @entity217 to a small group of college students that included former @entity221 chairman @entity220 , he spoke to countless university audiences , and he was famously photographed playing pool on @entity225 's west side with " the boys in the hood " -- not to mention the touching photos of him with his own lovely children 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 @entity17 was determined to remain relevant to a dynamic freedom movement that rode on the backs of students despite the fact that , ultimately , he was bound by conscience to criticize the most militant expressions of that youth culture , largely dominated by @entity237 , @entity238 of " black power " fame , anti-war hippies , and @entity242 , co-founder and icon of the @entity244 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
 his inner moral compass compelled him to criticize ideologies that encouraged further racial separatism and / or violence 	@entity291 : @placeholder was an especially skilled communicator
