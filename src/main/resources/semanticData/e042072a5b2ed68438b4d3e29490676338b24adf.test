@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- a dog 's life is fairly easy 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 it usually involves waking up late , eating some food and then passing out for eight hours in the backyard 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i 've tried it a few times , myself 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 was n't disappointed 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 the rest of a dog 's day is generally spent whizzing on various plants and mindlessly staring at things that pass by the house 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 again , i 've dabbled in the lifestyle 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and i approve 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 but there 's this one dog in @entity0 , @entity1 , who just seems to have it better than most 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and i recently got to meet her 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i first learned of @entity21 when i saw a popular picture of her on the website @entity24 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 it was posted in a section called " aww " that is dedicated to all things cute and adorable -- puppies , bunnies , @entity31 doing @entity31 things in @entity31 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 the photo showed @entity34 staring out from under a gate , and the title read : waiting for his family to return in @entity0 , @entity1 [ @entity39 ] 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 it got dozens of comments 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 in @entity24 parlance , [ @entity39 ] means @entity43 , which is to say the individual who posted the image actually created it 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 this was helpful when it came to tracking down the whereabouts of this dog ( who we now know is actually a female ) 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 you see , i was going to @entity0 over @entity56 and was looking for a pointless adventure -- something that would take me to a particular part of town i may not have otherwise seen 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and i figured trying to find this dog from @entity24 was as good enough an adventure as any 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 so , i messaged the guy who took the photograph and learned that his name is @entity66 , 31 , of @entity67 , @entity68 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity66 and his girlfriend , @entity69 , were driving home from vacation and decided to stop and spend the night in @entity0 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 while wandering around the historic neighborhoods near the battery , @entity66 stumbled upon @entity34 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " he seemed like the kind of dog quite used to this routine , " @entity66 wrote me 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " but not anxious about his family returning 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 just slightly forlorn 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " @entity66 did n't know the exact location of the house , but he sent me a link to an approximate street view on @entity83 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 eventually , i sorted out the actual address on my own , thus exhausting my brain 's entire lifetime supply of deductive reasoning 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i treated myself to a nap 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 finally , on the saturday after @entity56 , i walked up to @entity34 's house and knocked on the old door leading into the courtyard 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 mind you , this kind of bold , unsolicited introduction is the kind of thing you can do when you 're a serious journalist hoping to write a fluff piece on somebody 's dog 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 otherwise , it 's sort of creepy 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 though , to be fair , even with my @entity2 business card in hand , it was still probably kind of creepy 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i 'm a mouth breather 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 nevertheless , @entity104 politely greeted me at the door along with @entity34 , who was carrying a boot in her mouth 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 it was @entity104 's boot 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 which is to say , it was now @entity34 's 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 her official name is @entity114 re	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 in @entity115 that translates to @entity21 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i learned she was actually born on @entity116 2002 , just around the corner from @entity104 's home 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 this year she turns 11 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and speaking of 11 , that was the exact number of yellow lab puppies in her litter 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity34 was the runt 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity104 's daughter , @entity123 , was friends with one of the children who lived around the corner from where @entity34 was born 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 the mother of the friend called up @entity104 's wife and said , " i hate to tell you this , but @entity123 's fallen in love with one of our puppies 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " @entity104 says , " we knew our goose was cooked 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " and right as he told me this , just like clockwork , @entity123 suddenly emerged through the courtyard door , returning from a jog 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity123 , a history student at the @entity144 , remembers first meeting @entity34 , and that most of the puppies were named after characters from the hit tv show , " friends 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " which , sadly , means somebody out there has a dog named @entity154 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 but when the breeders ran out of " friends " characters , they started using @entity160 names 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity34 , being the runt , was originally called @entity162 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and names are important 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 if you 've ever adopted a dog you know how influential they can be 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 my dog is @entity168 , and when i first found him online and saw his name , i figured it was a sign 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 i 'm a big fan of the band @entity170 , and their late guitarist also went by @entity168 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 clearly , it was meant to be 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 of course , @entity168 ( my dog ) was also really cute 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 so , at the time , i pretty much could 've justified any name 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " this is polio 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " " i 'll take him 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " but @entity34 seems to fit this particular dog quite nicely , and these days she spends most of her time in the courtyard of the historic 200 - year - old house , looking out at tourists walking down the street 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 it 's pretty much her job 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 and , though she only recently earned a bit of internet fame on @entity24 , it 's certainly not the first time @entity34 has come under the lens 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 @entity104 says , " literally almost every day i see somebody taking a picture of her with her nose under the gate 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " in the @entity195 neighborhood of @entity0 , @entity34 is sort of a big deal 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 everybody knows her , and she 's an important member of the community 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 in fact , @entity34 recently escaped from the yard during the annual @entity201 , and , just like a local , simply joined all the joggers running down @entity203 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 another time , she got out of the yard and spent the entire day riding around in a pedicab 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " the guy had her in the back and was trying to figure out where she belonged , " @entity123 remembers 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " i do n't think she wanted to come back 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 she made a friend 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " @entity104 chimes in , " @entity34 likes all dogs and most people 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 " just do n't take her boot 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
 follow @ @entity213 on @entity214 	@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
