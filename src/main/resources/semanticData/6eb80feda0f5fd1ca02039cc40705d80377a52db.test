( @entity1 ) the @entity0 insists it does n't need congressional approval for the @entity4 nuclear deal announced this month 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without @entity10 , the @entity6 administration should probably learn another lesson from history : getting @entity10 ' signature might be worth the effort 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 true , the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 but it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive - based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of @entity10 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 the president and his advisers have avoided using the term " treaty , " instead explaining that it would be a " nonbinding agreement 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " according to secretary of state @entity35 : " we 've been very clear from the beginning 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 we 're not negotiating a ' legally binding plan 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 ' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " on " @entity45 , " @entity35 said , " what we 're looking for is not to have @entity10 interfere with our ability , inappropriately , by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the president 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " there is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues , with the potential for court challenges 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 but outside of the legal debate , there are also significant political questions , and those are a different beast altogether 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 for a start , there is growing pressure on @entity58 -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give @entity10 the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 on tuesday , a deal was reached on legislation proposed by @entity69 chairman @entity68 that would require president @entity6 to submit the final deal to @entity10 , giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity68 told @entity72 on tuesday that negotiators had reached a " bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact , full of integrity 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " what 's in the @entity4 bill and why all the fuss 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 there is good reason for @entity6 to avoid calling this a treaty 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 after all , given the contentious political environment on @entity58 , where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget , the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 but there is also a history of @entity10 causing significant trouble for important international treaties 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 in the late 1970s , for example , president @entity95 tried to obtain consent for the @entity99 treaties , but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that @entity95 was weak on defense 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity95 pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 after @entity4 took @entity109 hostages and the @entity110 invaded @entity111 , the treaties died in the @entity69 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment , presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political capital , and even once the @entity0 exited the struggle bruised and battered , the historic treaties endured 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity123 , @entity122 senators say @entity4 compromise reached this was the case with another treaty that @entity95 asked the @entity69 to ratify : the @entity128 of 1978 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity95 decided that turning authority of the canal over to @entity131 was essential to regional peace and stability 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 he knew this would be tough sell , and @entity138 @entity137 @entity136 for his part predicted he would n't even get 20 votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the @entity69 to save the @entity143 and the @entity144 to save the @entity143 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 indeed , they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the @entity110 a foothold in the region 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 however , @entity95 countered aggressively , both on a personal level -- helping secure the vote of sen	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity152 of @entity153 by sending a personal letter to the senator , dispatching experts to @entity153 to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state - of - the - art telephone hookups 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 in the end , the @entity69 ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two - thirds majority , although @entity95 also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 president @entity168 faced a similar challenge 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 toward the end of his presidency , he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the @entity110 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 yet despite excitement in the @entity0 and across the nation about @entity110 leader @entity178 's visit to @entity179 in december 1987 , many conservatives blasted the decision , arguing that @entity168 had betrayed the conservative cause 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 during a meeting at the @entity0 , eight @entity137 senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with @entity168 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 sen	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity186 of @entity187 , one of @entity168 's closest allies , said : " the @entity110 have broken most every treaty they have ever signed 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 how do we assure compliance with the new treaty 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " right - wing organizations , meanwhile , compared @entity168 with @entity195 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity168 responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 in a hearing on the treaty , secretary of state @entity199 attacked @entity203 @entity137 @entity202 , who had accused @entity168 of " confusion , misstatements and 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 even misrepresentation 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " he met with @entity137 , spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 despite their protests , most republicans eventually came around 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 on may 27 , 1988 , the @entity69 ratified the treaty 93 - 5 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 @entity202 , one of the few to vote against the treaty , admitted they were " licked 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 " and the treaty , which marked @entity216 for the @entity217 , has endured 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 the reality is that the signature of @entity10 is still worth a lot in @entity109 politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 all this will be true with @entity4 , especially as many members of @entity6 's own party are leery about the agreement 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 ultimately , the president probably has the right to go his own way with this , and his frustration with @entity10 might create strong incentives for doing so 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 but in the long term , persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent @entity4 from becoming a nuclear power 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 the good news is that there have been some statements from the @entity0 that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of @entity10 in a solid deal 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
 now it 's time to see if the administration follows through 	framework agreement with @placeholder over its nuclear program was reached this month
