( @entity0 ) -- president @entity3 's @entity2 address tuesday night is likely to be the most important domestic speech that he gives during the rest of his presidency -- but not for the reasons commonly cited 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 conventional wisdom holds that the address offers the president the biggest platform -- and audience -- he will have to lay out his agenda and priorities for the next four years 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 environmentalists are eagerly awaiting his promises on regulation of existing coal - fired power plants , on the @entity18 and on international climate negotiations 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 the anti-gun community wants to know if he will fight for an assault weapons ban 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 @entity23 want to see how he will advance on immigration 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 and so on 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 and on 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 these and other issues are significant and will feature heavily in post-address analysis 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 but at the end of the day , the transcendent issue -- at least for most @entity29 right now -- is whether the president will propel the economy forward by breaking the deadlock on the nation 's fiscal mess 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 this @entity2 address is probably the last chance that @entity3 has to reignite serious negotiations over a " grand bargain 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 " absent some sort of breakthrough soon , we are heading toward a sequester ( lots of automatic spending cuts in domestic and defense programs ) in march 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 that will in turn set off new rounds of squabbling and the likelihood that for months if not years to come , the nation will careen from one mini-crisis to the next , failing to solve underlying problems 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 for @entity3 , economists from @entity56 to @entity57 have argued for some time that jobs and growth would be best served by a two - stage process : new spending on infrastructure and the like in the near term ( more stimulus ) followed by iron - clad reductions in deficits over the long haul 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 instead , @entity69 is inviting just the opposite : a round of spending cuts in the near followed by weak , inadequate reductions in deficits over the long haul 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 both will be a drag on growth and jobs 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 @entity79 argue that @entity80 are to blame -- and clearly they deserve a great deal of criticism , especially for their obstructionism 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 but the day after the elections , @entity84 house speaker @entity84 offered tax increases , a huge concession , and now it is the @entity79 who seem less willing to make tough choices and strike a long - term bargain 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 moreover , @entity3 is the only leader in @entity69 elected by all the people , and as president , he has prime responsibility for finding a path forward 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 what can he do in his @entity2 to achieve a breakthrough 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 two suggestions : first , he should make a forthright new offer to republicans : in exchange for them calling off the sequester and agreeing to infrastructure investments , he will offer them a set of concrete steps he will support to bring @entity108 and @entity109 under control 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 in addition , he will name negotiators to work with @entity113 , starting this year , on tax and entitlement changes , and additional tax increases and spending cuts to put our house in order 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 both sides will have to compromise further than they have so far on cherished commitments 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 second , the president should commit to working with republicans to create a new tone for their relationship 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 instead of each side looking upon negotiations as " i win ; you lose , " the goal must be to create a " win - win 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 " it is not necessary that each side like the other , but it is necessary that each side puts country first 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 are these two steps hopelessly idealistic 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 probably 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 if anything , all signs point in exactly the opposite direction 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 on substance , the president continues to say he would like a grand bargain but mostly on his terms , and he has done virtually nothing to fight for it 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 indeed , in his inaugural , he seemed to step back from overhauling entitlements , portraying himself as chief defender of @entity108 and @entity109 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 as the sequester approaches , he has offered a tactical set of small - bore proposals , not a strategic plan that would break the deadlock 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 down deep , has he decided that he does n't really care whether we solve the deficit mess on his watch -- that he accepts the liberal notion that it 's a problem for 2020 , not now 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 one wonders 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 on tone , the president has pivoted even more 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 instead of the conciliatory @entity3 of the first term , we have seen a hard - nosed pugilist who paints republicans as wackos ready to hurt senior citizens and starve children to protect the rich 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 it was discouraging to read monday 's lead article in @entity171 in which correspondent @entity174 , citing @entity79 in the @entity172 and on @entity173 , reported that @entity3 in his @entity2 will offer the @entity80 not an olive branch but a cattle prod 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 one @entity3 aide close to the drafting process quoted @entity179 : " build your enemy a golden bridge on which to retreat 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 " this is a team that wants a win - win negotiation over the deficits 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 the suspicion deepens that the @entity3 folks have secretly adopted a strategy of making @entity80 look so extreme that they will be driven from power in 2014 and the president can then govern as he chooses in his final two years in office 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 for the country 's sake , one hopes this suspicion is wrong 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 the window for achieving a grand bargain has been closing rapidly and could slam shut tuesday night 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 	he says @placeholder 's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake
