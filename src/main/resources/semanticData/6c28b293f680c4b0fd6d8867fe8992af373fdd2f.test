( @entity1 ) on thursday , president @entity0 revealed that a @entity3 drone strike had killed @entity4 and @entity5 , two aid workers held hostage on the @entity10 - @entity9 border 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity11 had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the @entity3 and an end to drone strikes 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 but it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of @entity22 , the @entity24 's @entity23 bureau chief 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 on april 20 , just two days before diplomats resumed talks in @entity29 , @entity30 , to reach a final agreement over @entity26 's nuclear program , @entity22 's @entity26 attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage , conducting propaganda , collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information " with malicious intent 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 " the @entity41 , @entity22 's employers at the @entity24 and fellow journalists reacted with outrage 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 their anger is justified , but the decision should surprise no one : there is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions , humiliate the @entity3 or signal unease 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the scale of @entity26 's current hostage - taking -- not only @entity22 but also @entity26 - @entity3 @entity56 and @entity57 -- may pale in comparison with @entity26 behavior of decades past 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 but the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 consider the original @entity26 hostage seizure : on november 4 , 1979 , radical students seized the @entity68 in @entity23 , ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 often forgotten was what sparked that episode , which occurred more than nine months after @entity73 declared the @entity75 revolution victorious 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the problem was a rush to reconcile : at a november 1 , 1979 , @entity79 reception , @entity80 , president @entity82 's national security adviser , met @entity26 prime minister @entity83 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 according to @entity80 's own memoir , he told @entity83 that the @entity3 was open to any relationship the @entity75 republic wanted 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity26 hardliners , meanwhile , were apoplectic that @entity93 was " betraying " @entity26 's revolutionary principles , and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity73 endorsed their action 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 " our young people must foil these plots , " he reportedly said 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity80 's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity26 released the embassy hostages as @entity109 took his oath of office , ending its first but not last hostage - taking episode 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity26 proxies seized a number of @entity3 in @entity114 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity109 blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the @entity122 , the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also , much as with @entity0 's outreach today , to solidify the moderate camp within the @entity26 political spectrum 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 initially , the scheme worked , but no sooner had @entity3 officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free , then kidnappers seized three more @entity3 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 hostage - taking had simply become another way to collect concessions 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 of course , @entity26 is not alone in such games 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 whenever the @entity3 tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold , it faces hostage crises 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 take @entity142 : @entity0 campaigned as the anti-bush on the world stage 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 " the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 is ridiculous , " @entity0 , then a senator , declared in july 2007 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity0 had n't even marked two months in office when @entity142 detained two journalists working for @entity153 's current tv 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 a kangaroo court sentenced @entity155 and @entity156 to 12 years in prison 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 it was traditional hostage diplomacy 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 former president @entity160 traveled to @entity161 to appeal for their release 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity142 leader @entity164 used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor , @entity168 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity142 's police force put out word that " general @entity168 's artifice let former @entity3 president @entity160 cross the @entity172 to apologize to the @entity173 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 it was all made possible thanks to general @entity168 's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 " @entity142 's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity155 and @entity182 were neither the first nor the last @entity3 that @entity142 seized during the @entity0 era 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 after @entity142 torpedoed a @entity186 ship , killing 46 , @entity0 sought @entity142 's censure in the @entity188 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity161 responded by threatening @entity189 , an @entity3 imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering @entity142 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 on cue , former president @entity82 arrived to mediate for @entity189 ' release , called for new talks and , by omission , derailed efforts to hold @entity142 accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen @entity186 sailors 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the pattern would repeat in 2012 when @entity142 seized @entity198 , an @entity3 whom @entity168 sought to leverage into concessions 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the following year , @entity142 arrested an 85 - year - old @entity202 veteran touring the hermit kingdom and , the next year , took two other tourists hostage 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 each arrest resulted in a high - level visit , an apology to @entity142 that bolstered the dear leader 's claims of strength and renewed engagement 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity212 likewise worked from the same playbook 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 in march 1995 , @entity215 security forces seized two @entity3 defense contractors who strayed into @entity215 from @entity217 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 sentenced to eight years , they served 114 days before rep	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 @entity218 , @entity219 , a close @entity160 ally ( and future @entity221 - level @entity188 ambassador ) flew to @entity222 to retrieve them 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 the @entity3 media lauded @entity218 , but his trip was not without cost : @entity212 used it to depict @entity215 as strong and @entity3 as weak 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 " president @entity212 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 accepts the pleas by @entity160 , the @entity230 and @entity3 people , " the @entity228 reported 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 and so did the @entity232 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 fifteen years before @entity0 traded alleged @entity3 deserter @entity233 for five high - value @entity232 and alleged @entity11 operatives imprisoned at @entity236 , the @entity232 arrested two @entity3 female missionaries 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of @entity160 - era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the @entity232 ; the @entity232 , too , knew how holding @entity3 captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 so what does @entity26 's hostage brinkmanship portend 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 diplomats drink their own kool - aid , and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 ego , ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 hostages such as @entity22 are canaries in the coal mine , however 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
 their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy 	@entity274 : hostages such as journalist @placeholder are canaries in the coal mine
