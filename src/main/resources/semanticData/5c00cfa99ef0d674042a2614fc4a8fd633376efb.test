 timeline of events @entity6 's shooting stirred memories of the @entity167 case in @entity168 , @entity169 , where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer 	footage shows a traffic stop and early interactions between officer @placeholder and @entity6
 a grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case 	footage shows a traffic stop and early interactions between officer @placeholder and @entity6

 " but i think , you know , he made a bad decision 	footage shows a traffic stop and early interactions between officer @placeholder and @entity6
 mr	footage shows a traffic stop and early interactions between officer @placeholder and @entity6
