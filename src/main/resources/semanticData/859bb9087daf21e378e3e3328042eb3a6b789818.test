( @entity2 ) supported by @entity4 intelligence and supplied with advanced @entity4 - made weaponry , @entity1 jets began airstrikes in @entity7 late last month in the name of what the kingdom 's @entity10 ambassador described as " restoring the legitimate government " and protecting a " @entity7 constitution and elections 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 " the need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 indeed , @entity1 motives in @entity7 likely have nothing to do with protecting the country 's " legitimate government , " its constitution or its electoral process 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 so what is really going on 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 the kingdom 's real motives seem clear if one looks at @entity1 monarchy 's history of not allowing regional competition of any kind , while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 this approach was evident in 2013 , when @entity1 voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of @entity43 in @entity44 , which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary @entity1 policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the @entity47 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 the @entity1 goal is simple : prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self - determination 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 and the excuse of " resisting @entity55 's influence , " meanwhile , appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 for example , in 2009 , the @entity58 ( more accurately described as the @entity60 ) were not yet receiving help from @entity55 , yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes , following @entity1 claims of a @entity58 incursion 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 true , the @entity67 movement now benefits from @entity55 support 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 but it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 with all this in mind , the @entity4 decision to stand behind the @entity1 attack on @entity7 can best be described as misguided 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 although the @entity58 movement 's rhetoric is unquestionably anti-american , it has not targeted any @entity4 interests 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 in fact , when the @entity4 @entity81 packed up in @entity82 in january , leaving a fleet of over 20 armored suvs behind at the airport , the @entity58 reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a @entity89 representative in @entity7 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 and while the @entity58 did not welcome the @entity4 presence in @entity7 , they did not interfere with @entity4 operations against @entity93 in the country 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 but one of the biggest miscalculations has been that @entity4 policy has adopted the @entity1 - @entity99 narrative on @entity7 , effectively placing @entity1 ambitions to control @entity7 above previous @entity4 priorities like destroying the safe haven for @entity93 there 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 indeed , the @entity104 administration appears to have abandoned @entity7 to @entity1 machinations 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 this reality was underscored when @entity4 @entity108 spokesperson @entity107 effectively endorsed @entity1 bombing , saying the " @entity1 have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in @entity7 on their security 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 " the implication here seems to be that any country " concerned " about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them , a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 back in september , @entity122 spokesman @entity121 described @entity7 as a success story in the war on terrorism , explaining that the @entity4 priority in @entity7 was not to establish a " jeffersonian democracy " but to prevent @entity7 from becoming a safe - haven for @entity93 and affiliates 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 yet if that policy goal remains in place , then it must be acknowledged that the @entity1 war on @entity7 will not only undermine the @entity4 aim of preventing @entity93 from making @entity7 a safe haven , but also undermine broader @entity4 efforts in @entity7 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 the reality is that @entity1 and @entity138 jets are effectively acting as @entity93 's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot @entity93 from several @entity7 regions 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 interestingly , while @entity1 deployed about 100 aircraft against the @entity58 on the second day of its offensive , it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early @entity4 - led campaign against @entity146 last year 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 regardless , the results of the @entity1 campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller @entity58 force than today was able to outfox the @entity1 military back in 2009 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 back then , @entity58 forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters , but they shocked the @entity1 army , reportedly capturing @entity1 equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 @entity1 villages as it seized territory along the border 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 today , that ragtag group of @entity58 rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called @entity60 , modeled after @entity165 's @entity164 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 back in 2009 , the rebels were limited to parts of the @entity169 region and were self - funded , although @entity7 claimed they had minor assistance from the late @entity172 leader @entity171 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 yet despite this , they were still able to withstand some 90 days of @entity1 bombardment 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 today , the @entity175 is receiving political , financial and military support from @entity55 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 already , the @entity1 government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports , and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 the situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 what should be done now 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 @entity1 interests in @entity7 should not replace those of the @entity4 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 with this in mind , the @entity104 administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict , one that can be embraced by the various @entity7 factions 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 a change in approach is essential not only because the @entity1 - led war on @entity7 is wrong and destined to fail , but because it might end up further opening the @entity7 door to @entity55 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
 but perhaps most importantly , by supporting a self - interested @entity1 campaign , the @entity4 may actually empower an @entity93 with the potential still to do great harm to the @entity4 	@placeholder has launched airstrikes against rebels in @entity7
