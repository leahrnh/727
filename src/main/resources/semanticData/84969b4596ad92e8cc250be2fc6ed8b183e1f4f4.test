( @entity2 ) recently , @entity1 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 believe it or not , @entity1 prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 there has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in @entity14 in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 except , it happens all the time 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 some have claimed this practice " evokes a dark corner of @entity14 history " where the mentally ill or " deficient " were forced to undergo sterilization 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 yeah , that 's true 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 we did that 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 and it was bad 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 except this is n't quite that 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 female sterilization is linked to the controversial " eugenics " movement , which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 there is even a 1927 @entity41 case , @entity40 , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and " imbeciles , " " for the protection and health of the state , " was constitutional 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 the opinion in the case is stunning , especially because the @entity41 has never technically overruled it 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 but @entity40 dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities , not because they were being punished for a crime 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 you can hate sterilization , and the @entity59 case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics , but it 's not that 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 present - day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime , and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 others may argue that the @entity41 has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment , and struck it down 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 that 's true too , sort of 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 in @entity78 v	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 @entity79 , the @entity41 struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional , but not because it was cruel and unusual 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 instead , the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 so the question remains : is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 the @entity88 provides : " excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 " practically , however , punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 we have executed people with hangings and by firing squad 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 sterilization has to be somewhere below that , right 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 ultimately , however , the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis , because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the @entity105 , it is permissible , if you willingly choose it 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 suppose arguendo ( for argument 's sake ) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment , violating the @entity88 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 this is where it gets interesting : it still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 shocked 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 you should n't be 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 as citizens , we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 you waive your @entity123 protections against search and seizure when you answer " yes " to an officer 's " mind if i look in your trunk 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 " you waive your @entity131 privilege against self - incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle 's trunk 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 so then , if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights , can we waive our @entity88 rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment , even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 and are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 nope 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country , and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 if sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional , and we 've been doing it for a while , then that begs the question : why the outrage now 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 why the story that a @entity59 prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 there are really only two possibilities 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 first , some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 second , even if we knew about it , we did n't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 most of the sterilization defendants are men 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 search your feelings , @entity178 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 when we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters , the idea of castration as punishment does n't sound so bad right 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 be honest : let go of your " we 're - all - equal - in - all - ways " banner for a moment 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 after all , not too long ago , execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 so if we 're ok with the gas chamber , we 're probably ok with a snip 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 it 's ok 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 you can admit it ; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias , whether we like it or not 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 still not convinced 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 watch this parlor trick : what if i suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 so far you 're not ruling it out 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 and what if it 's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17 - year - old student 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 most of our gut feelings shifted from " maybe " to " no " just now 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 it 's ok to admit that , too 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 of course , sterilization wo n't prevent a female sex offender from offending again , no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 but the point is , somehow , the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 maybe it 's that on a primal , unconscious level , what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 even if you 're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a " shocking " news story , you must concede it fits 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar , but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 of course , we have to consider the related justification 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 overall , a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 just ask any domestic violence prosecutor 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 are sterilization plea deals morally right 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 it 's hard to say 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 for now , they appear to be constitutional , but controversial 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 if we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child , should the government step in 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 if so , to what degree 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
 fortunately , we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now : just keep neutering the men 	@placeholder 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
