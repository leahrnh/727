( @entity1 ) it 's not going to be enough to slake the thirst of the elusive @entity4 bunny , but scientists say new research seems to support the theory that what looks like a bone - dry red planet during the day could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 experts have long thought that a particular kind of salt detected in @entity4 soil could pull water vapor from the the planet 's thin atmosphere into the soil at night and then keep it from freezing despite the extreme cold 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 researchers are n't saying they 've seen direct evidence of brine hiding out in the @entity4 night 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 but they say the new study -- based on a full year of monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions by the @entity28 in @entity29 -- does seem to bear the theory out 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 " @entity29 is one of the least likely places on @entity4 to have conditions for brines to form , compared to sites at higher latitudes or with more shading , " said @entity31 of the @entity32 at @entity33 , a co-author of the new report 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 @entity44 chief scientist : ' indications ' of alien life by 2025 " so if brines can exist there , that strengthens the case they could form and persist even longer at many other locations , " possibly explaining channels seen on @entity4 that appear be formed by running water , he said 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 researchers say @entity4 may once have had an sea as extensive as @entity56 's @entity55 , and @entity28 has found evidence of ancient streambeds and a lake on the planet 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 the vast majority of that water has been lost to space over the eons , leaving @entity4 an overwhelmingly dry and inhospitable place 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 the new study does n't change the picture for life on @entity4 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 the researchers say the temperatures they measured are too low and water too scarce " to support terrestrial organisms " ( sorry , bunny fans ) 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 but scientists say evidence of water ice at the planet 's poles and now more evidence toward the theory of widespread brines keeps them hoping they 'll find evidence that life at least once existed there 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 " liquid water is a requirement for life as we know it , and a target for @entity4 exploration missions , " lead author @entity85 said in a statement 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 " conditions near the surface of present - day @entity4 are hardly favorable for microbial life as we know it , " he said , " but the possibility for liquid brines on @entity4 has wider implications for habitability and geological water - related processes 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 " in other words , we 'll keep looking 	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
 @entity4 is the next step for humanity -- we must take it	analysis of @placeholder weather seems to support the idea that the planet could be dotted with salty puddles at night
