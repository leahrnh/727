 the testimony of anesthesiologist expert dr	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 @entity219 , concluded monday morning , 11 days after he took the stand as the prosecution 's 33rd , but perhaps most important , witness 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 @entity219 testified last week that there was no way @entity6 got only the amount of propofol @entity3 said he did , based on the high level of the drug found in blood taken during his autopsy 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 the " only scenario " to explain @entity6 's death was that he overdosed on propofol infused through an iv drip set up by @entity3 , @entity219 said 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 the @entity236 coroner ruled that @entity6 's death was a homicide , the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 the defense contends @entity6 self - administered the fatal dose , along with sedatives , without @entity3 knowing 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 @entity219 said the level of propofol in @entity6 's blood taken during his autopsy could not have been from either @entity3 or @entity6 injecting the drug , but only from an iv system that was still flowing when his heart stopped 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week

 " can you rule out the possibility that @entity6 manipulated something to cause it to flow 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 " deputy district attorney @entity61 asked friday 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 " that 's a possibility , " @entity219 said 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 but that is assuming @entity3 set up the drip and left @entity6 's side , he said 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 would @entity219 's opinion that @entity3 was responsible for @entity6 's death change if he knew @entity6 turned the drip on 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 " no , if @entity6 had reached up , seen the roller clamp and opened it himself , this is a foreseeable consequence of setting up an essentially dangerous way of giving drugs , " @entity219 said 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 " it does n't change things at all 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
 it would still be considered abandonment 	@placeholder may miss the verdict if the trial lasts into next week
