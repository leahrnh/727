 for @entity7 and its regional allies , the @entity3 military intervention in @entity15 -- " @entity20 " -- is the moment the @entity23 finally woke up to repel the expansion of @entity26 - @entity2 influence 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 for @entity6 and its regional allies -- including the @entity29 movement in @entity15 -- @entity3 's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the @entity15 crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it

 from @entity45 and @entity46 to @entity47 and the @entity48 , the @entity2 - @entity3 rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 and yet despite @entity39 's open pledge , profound differences over @entity53 and @entity54 in particular have kept @entity7 and @entity6 apart 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 but if the questions of @entity53 and @entity54 prevented a pause in hostilities , the @entity3 military intervention in @entity15 since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it

 seeking a political solution is @entity2 's stated aim for the @entity15 crisis , but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 @entity2 foreign minister @entity134 has provided a four - point plan : to get a ceasefire , to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid , to promote political dialogue among warring @entity15 parties , and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 but the @entity2 proposal also asks for an end to @entity3 airstrikes 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 as @entity134 put it , " @entity2 and @entity3 need to talk , but we can not talk to determine the future of @entity15 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 " the @entity3 have thus far ignored the @entity2 proposal 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it

 as one of its leaders said , " in @entity2 's plan , unacceptable solutions do not exist 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it

 this leaves @entity7 with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in @entity15 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 @entity3 airstrikes alone will not finish off the @entity29 movement and it allies in the @entity15 armed forces 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 it requires ground troops on a huge scale 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 @entity7 has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 the @entity47 most famously turned down the @entity3 request and let it be known that @entity15 is a quagmire they can do without 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 instead , @entity185 has asked @entity2 to push the @entity29 for a political compromise that @entity7 can live with 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 the @entity187 were enthusiastic at first about stopping the @entity29 -- but in his visit to @entity6 last week , @entity187 president @entity188 made it clear that he has prioritized @entity2 - @entity187 trade relations over rivalry in @entity15 , and emphasized a political solution for the @entity15 conflict 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 the @entity195 and the @entity196 are still supportive of @entity3 efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist @entity7 in @entity15 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 but whether they will go through with it is another matter 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 @entity195 has a long list of problems of its own , including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in @entity206 that it can not afford to lose , but also an eastern border with lawless @entity209 that is increasingly a new front in @entity211 's fight against jihadists 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 it is hard to see how @entity195 general @entity214 can commit troops to a @entity15 campaign that is not a direct threat to @entity195 's security 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 the same kind of domestic realities , including the threat from @entity222 , will also prevent @entity196 from any significant contribution to @entity3 military efforts in @entity15 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 these hard realities leave @entity7 with two options 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it

 alternatively , given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops , @entity7 will have to contemplate a full - scale invasion of @entity15 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 the @entity2 too are faced with stark choices 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 it is beyond @entity6 's ability to tame the @entity15 crisis 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 as tempting as it might be for @entity6 to see the @entity3 bleed in @entity15 , the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the @entity11 will undermine broader regional @entity2 interests 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
 a political compromise that both @entity7 and @entity6 and their respective @entity15 allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic 	@placeholder has proposed a four - point plan for @entity15 but @entity3 have ignored it
