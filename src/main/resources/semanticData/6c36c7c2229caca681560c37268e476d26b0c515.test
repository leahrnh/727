 it comes in a yellow - labeled bottle with a fire - breathing demon on it 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it tastes like @entity16 chewing gum 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it 's @entity18 , and lately it 's been as hot as its name 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " @entity18 is number one , definitely 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 that 's pretty much the chosen shot , " said @entity1 , who enjoys it herself now and then 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " on an average night , we probably go through three or four bottles 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " if you 're young -- say , under 35 -- this may not be news to you 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 fireball , which did n't exist in its current form a decade ago , is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 retail sales more than doubled last year , and @entity18 has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the @entity35 as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 and these figures do n't include sales in bars , where @entity31 has dethroned @entity46 as @entity48 shot of choice 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 or social media feeds , which fill with photos of fireball - flavored revelry and # @entity54 hashtags 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " @entity18 is an incredible phenomenon 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 the growth of it has just been astounding , " said @entity56 , managing editor of @entity57 and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " for a whiskey , this is unprecedented 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " to the uninitiated , @entity18 is basically made from @entity68 whisky , aged in used bourbon barrels , flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 ( the " whisky " spelling generally refers to @entity73 or @entity68 varieties , while " whiskey " refers to @entity76 or @entity35 styles 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 ) its slogan is " tastes like heaven , burns like hell , " but that 's an exaggeration 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 fireball has a kick , but it does n't burn as much as straight whiskeys , cheap tequilas or even the @entity31 hard candy that helped inspire its name 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it 's also only 66 proof , or 33 % alcohol -- less than most whiskeys 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " it 's so easy to drink that you forget you 're drinking alcohol 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it 's very sweet 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 you hardly taste the whiskey at all , " said @entity95 , a bartender at @entity96 in @entity97 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " i 've known people who ca n't do shots , but they can do @entity18 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women , many of whom say they like that it does n't singe their throat and leaves a @entity110 - like aftertaste 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 but not everyone is a fan 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single - malt @entity73 -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " i 've got to be honest : it 's not anything i 'd reach for , at any occasion , " @entity56 said 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " but clearly i 'm not in the mainstream 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " fireball was n't always fireball 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it used to be known as dr	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 @entity124 's @entity123 before its maker , the @entity125 , rebranded it in 2006 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 sales were modest until about five years ago , when @entity125 hired a " national brand ambassador , " @entity129 , to spread the word about @entity18 through event planning and bartender outreach 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 in other words , @entity129 traveled the country serving up fireball shots in bars 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 he started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures , such as @entity140 and @entity141 , and then spread to other places 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 everywhere he went , @entity129 shared his @entity144 exploits on @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 and encouraged patrons to do the same 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 soon , @entity18 started gaining traction 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 then it exploded 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 retail sales jumped from just under $ 2 million in 2011 to $ 63 million in 2013 to $ 130 million last year , according to @entity152 , a @entity153 - based market research firm 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 along the way , @entity125 has cultivated a party - hearty social ethos around @entity18 , encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as # @entity160 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 the brand has more than 85,000 followers on @entity146 and another 43,000 on @entity147 -- more than twice the social reach of @entity46 -- although on @entity146 , it still trails @entity165 's whiskey and patron tequila 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 and it got a boost in october when someone taped a @entity171 camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 the resulting video has more than 2	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
3 million @entity179 views 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " our fans love it , and they spread the word 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 the fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing , " said @entity184 , public relations and events manager for @entity125 , who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand 's booming popularity 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " we are very excited and humbled 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " so is fireball a future cornerstone of every well - stocked bar or just a fad 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 it may be too soon to say 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 retail sales remain strong , according to @entity152 , although @entity18 's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 but it 's under siege from several fronts 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 the past year has brought copycats @entity202 and @entity203 , both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup , along with cinnamon vodkas , cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 fireball also endured a public - relations mess last fall when several @entity212 countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients : propylene glycol , a chemical used in a variety of food products , e-cigarettes and antifreeze 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 @entity125 responded that propylene glycol exists in @entity31 " in very small quantities " -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the @entity227 ( @entity228 ) -- and reassured customers that @entity18 is " absolutely safe to drink 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " then there 's the question of whether @entity18 will become a victim of its own success 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 young consumers are notoriously fickle , and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " it just reached a point where i could n't drink it anymore , " said @entity95 , the @entity97 bartender 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " i think it was the sugar 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " still , its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 glasses are raised , someone makes a toast , and down go shots of an orange , syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 " it 's an easy shot 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 you can drink a lot of them 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
 with @entity18 , you do n't need a chaser , " said @entity259 , a bartender at the @entity260 in @entity97 	@placeholder is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in @entity35
