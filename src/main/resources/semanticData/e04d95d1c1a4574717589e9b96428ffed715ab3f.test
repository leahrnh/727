 ( @entity52 ) : i would imagine as a retail operation you 'd be a huge proponent of a single currency within the @entity50 	retail division seeing annual growth of 25 percent , up to 30 percent in @placeholder
 is it realistic within the next 4 to 5 years 	retail division seeing annual growth of 25 percent , up to 30 percent in @placeholder
