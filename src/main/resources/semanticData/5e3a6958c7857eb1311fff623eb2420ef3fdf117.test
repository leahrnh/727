 " just put that into perspective : it 's about twice the number that went into @entity28 in the 1980s over a 10 - year period to fight the @entity30 , and those came really from only a handful of countries 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21

 the @entity4 now lists 62 countries in the coalition 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 as the @entity4 - led coalition has focused attention on @entity47 and @entity21 , @entity0 has expanded its reach to @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 @entity14 did not rule out expanding @entity4 military action beyond @entity47 and @entity21 to combat the increasing regional threat 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 " we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , " he said 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 " of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 " the @entity4 has also been stepping up efforts to involve @entity70 groups in the fight against @entity0 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as @entity70 tribes see @entity75 militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21

 " but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in @entity21 and @entity47 is that they 're more likely to get killed in @entity47 and @entity21 , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as @entity0 leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female @entity104 fighter in the streets of @entity106 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
 " that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : " the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up 	@entity10 's point man in @entity0 fight does n't rule out @entity4 military action beyond @placeholder and @entity21
