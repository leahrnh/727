 @entity24 says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 many of them are transsexuals who want a new body , he says 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 but he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 another big obstacle is the need for a partner 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity24 ca n't just do this in his own @entity72 lab	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the @entity76 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he hopes to get a buy - in this summer when he presents his plan to the @entity78 , or @entity79 , at its annual conference in june 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he 's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity84 , executive director of @entity79 , says the group is not endorsing @entity24 , it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 if @entity24 does n't get the support he needs in the @entity76 , he 'll look to @entity89 and his timeline will slide by a year 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 once these pieces are in place , @entity24 says he 'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 many of them , like the patient , are already identified because they 've asked to be part of this team 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 then they 'll need to practice for what is anticipated to be a 36 - hour operation 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 " i say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization , " @entity24 speculates 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 but what about the science 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 is such an idea even plausible 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he says he has research that supports it 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease

 @entity112 , who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at @entity117 in 1970 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 the monkey died after eight days , because the body rejected the new head 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 before ithe monkey died , it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 the monkey also was unable to breathe on its own 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 the paper in which @entity24 outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment @entity112 conducted with six monkey heads , none of which survived more than 24 hours 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 but @entity24 says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems @entity112 faced 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease

 @entity137 , chairman of neurological surgery at @entity139 and president - elect of the @entity141 , says @entity112 's research is not validation for a human head transplant 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 " [ it 's ] a 45 - year - old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally , " he says 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity137 further explains that it 's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function , which @entity112 did not look at 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity24 is confident in his writing and in conversation 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he cites @entity112 's monkeys and even the success of @entity159 researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk , giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he published his paper in the free , online , medical journal @entity169 in 2013 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he walks readers through a scenario , outlining the key points that will make this work , including cooling the spinal cord before severing it 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients , he says 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he 'll use a " magic ingredient " as a sealant to fuse the spinal cord back together and offers a few options for what that ingredient could be 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 the nerves , having been color - coded when separated , will be carefully aligned and this will all be done very quickly because time is key 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 an impossibility , according to @entity137 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he conceded that the airway , the spine , the major veins and arteries , can all be put back together , but the spinal cord is the problem 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he says the result would be the inability to move or breathe 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease

 " @entity208 says this has to be done in many animals before it 's tried on humans 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity208 also points out that if @entity24 can do this , he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords , before transplanting whole bodies 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 as for the patients , @entity208 says , " their bodies would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they 'd go crazy 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 " in his paper , @entity24 says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he also says pain could be a problem 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 as far as immunosuppression , @entity24 points to today 's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 @entity208 is n't buying it 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he 's seen how difficult it is for his @entity211 colleagues who perform face transplants 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 the levels of anti-rejection medications required are so high they put patients at risk for cancer and kidney problems 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 he says it does n't make sense that you 'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 another issue @entity208 has seen with face transplant patients is they do n't always get full function of their new organ 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
 " it 's not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else , " @entity208 says 	the first patient will be a 30 - year - old @placeholder man with a rare , genetic muscle wasting disease
