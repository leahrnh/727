 it was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago , on thursday , april 12 , 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 the second city editor , @entity16 , was to my left 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 to my right , perhaps 6 feet away , the telegraph editor , @entity19 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 at 4:50 , the old - fashioned upright " candlestick " telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line @entity25 used to alert editors to major news events 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 he answered , replaced the bell - like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular , " @entity34 is dead 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 " the silence of shock 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218

 @entity91 , who usually handled labor stories , had been told " to do something on the new president 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 " he opened the @entity88 envelope , spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the " books " in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen : five sheets of copy paper stapled together , with four sheets of carbon paper between 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 to be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies : the top one for the editor , a carbon copy for the reporter 's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks @entity91 's eyes moved over the clippings , evaluating , rejecting , selecting , deciding what to use 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 at last , he started typing 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 because of the time pressure , the story would be done in " short takes " : two , maybe three paragraphs at a time 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 he wrote : " the new president -- the 33d in the history of the @entity126 -- is @entity88 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218

 i left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to @entity50 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
 back by @entity91 , i read over his shoulder : " born in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity88 's political rise was spectacular 	president @placeholder died suddenly 70 years ago april 12 in @entity307 , @entity218
