@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- i am a big - time news junkie but there are days in which i do n't turn on the television because i do n't want to find out who 's next 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the next to fall 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the next to be torn down 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the next to have their nice and shiny public persona ripped apart , doused with gas and set on fire -- done in by the always lethal combination of private shortcomings and stupidity 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 or arrogance 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 or whatever it is that makes politicians and other public figures believe " no one is going to find out 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 " but we do find out , do n't we 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 if you cheat on your spouse -- the mistress talks 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 take a bribe -- there 's a receipt 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 whisper something offensive under your breath , in your car -- alone -- with the windows down and the radio up and somehow , someway there 's an audible clip of it posted on @entity40 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and so i have my days when i try to avoid the news 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 i do n't blame reporters for doing their job 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 only people running for office tend to do that 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 rather there are days i do n't need to be told about this new kind of @entity50 we 're living in 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the kind without gods or role models 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the kind without heroes 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 you remember that @entity59 song that said we did n't need another one of those 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 well at times , today 's 24 - hour news cycle can be a callous reminder that we never really had heroes in the first place 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we were just blissfully ignorant 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 imagine if @entity66 or @entity67 was around when @entity68 was singing to president @entity69 or if smart phones were available to capture video of @entity72 getting drunk in bars and picking up women 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 our opinions of those iconic figures would certainly be different 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and we would n't be behaving as if things have somehow gotten worse 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we would know that the country was never as pious as we like to think it was 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 each time i hear someone like @entity82 romanticize our past -- as if everyone was living in an episode of " @entity86 " -- i throw up in my mouth just a little 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 sure our history is peppered with self - sacrificing individuals who did a tremendous amount of good for the whole of society 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and if the narrative would just stop there we would n't be so troubled to learn about their flaws or the flaws of self - sacrificing people of today 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 but we do n't stop 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we worship 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and when we find out our gods are not perfect , we 're confused 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we do n't know what to do with a storyline where the perceived protagonist is complex 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 heroes are n't supposed to do bad things 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 that 's what villains are for 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 so either the good supersedes the bad , or the bad makes it impossible to remember the good 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we do n't like it when such duality exists in one person 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 we do n't want to know our heroes are human 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 for example , i have two images of the rev	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 @entity119 locked in my head 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the first is the brave civil rights soldier who risked his life working side by side with dr	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 @entity126 the second is the lowlife who not only brought his pregnant mistress to the @entity131 but posed for pictures with her standing next to president @entity133 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 what do you do with that kind of duality 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 you turn off the television 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 at least for little while 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and you try to remember that few people are as good as advertised and even fewer are as bad as rumored 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 that in the new @entity50 , pedestals are best reserved for flowers , not people 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 part of the reason why so many people came rushing to @entity149 's defense is because the @entity151 coach had done so much good for the school and the community 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 he was supposed to be a man above reproach , born within the shadow of our greatest generation 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 it is so hard for some to accept the possibility that one of our great heroes could have been involved in something not becoming of the title 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and i found that sentiment more shocking than @entity149 's connection to the allegations 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 after all , scandals involving football coaches at big - time schools happen so frequently it was hard for me to imagine anyone being surprised 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 if a story broke tomorrow that president @entity177 was cheating on @entity178 , i would be disappointed but not surprised 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 how could i be given the number of stories about politicians having extramarital affairs 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 i do n't believe such an attitude is cynical , just pragmatic 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 i do n't personally know @entity149 or @entity177 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 but i do know people can make mistakes 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 and if we 're to ever have public figures to look up to ever again , we have to start allowing for that 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 mistakes 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 because in the old @entity50 , our heroes could be " perfect " -- since the public would never find out their flaws 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 those kind of stories simply would not be written @entity194 in the new @entity50 that is n't possible 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 with technology and social media and citizen journalism , every rock that used to go unturned is now being flipped , lit and put on tv 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 which is why sometimes , i just do n't turn mine on 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 	@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @placeholder , one without heroes
