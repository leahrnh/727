( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 will always be most famous for " @entity2 , " the 1988 novel that earned the author a death warrant from the @entity6 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 but for literary merit alone , some rate the earlier " @entity9 " as @entity1 's greatest work 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 now , the classic novel is hitting the movie screen in an adaptation by @entity1 himself 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 the author 's first foray into screenwriting was not an easy assignment , he admits 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 after all , the book encompasses 30 years of @entity22 's history , from independence from @entity24 in 1947 to the turbulent rule of prime minister @entity26 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 spoke with the renowned writer about the cinematic rendering of his book , directed by @entity30 ( out in limited release now ) 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 below is an edited version of the conversation 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : " @entity9 " was published in 1981 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 it took a long time to become a movie 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 had you always wanted it to be made into a film 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : i never had a real desperate need for it to be a film 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i was quite happy for it to just be a book , and actually , i had sort of given up on the idea there would be a film because of how long it had been since the book came out 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 ( i had ) this serendipitous conversation with @entity30 where we actually met to talk about other things , and it suddenly popped into her head to ask about " @entity9 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 " i had known her for a while , and she had spoken to me very passionately about her feeling for the book and what it had meant to her when she read it and how it connected to her own experiences 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i thought , well , that 's valuable , because it means that that 's not just a gig 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 it 's not just taking the job in order to adapt this film , but it becomes a personal project , and that 's what i felt made her the right person to ( direct ) 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : how satisfied are you with the translation to this new medium 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : i 'm actually delighted , but on the other hand , i 'm scarcely objective , you know , because i wrote the film and i narrate the film , and i was very , very involved at every stage of it 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i was involved in the casting 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i was even involved in talking to the production designer , showing him photographs of ( my ) childhood and trying to get him to make the film look right 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i was involved in the cutting room 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 so if the film is no good , it 's my fault too , but if it is any good , i can take a bit of the credit 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 one of the things i like is that young people in the audience have found it easy to connect to their lives 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 it does n't feel like a period piece 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i worried that this is a story which ends in 1977 and might feel to a lot of people like ancient history 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 but i just think that there is something about the way in which small individual lives are impacted by the great events of history which is easy for us to connect to now when the great events of history , almost on a daily basis , assault our individual lives 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : how challenging did you find it to write the screenplay 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : well , of course it 's challenging , but , you know , all writing is challenging 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 writing is difficult ; one should just say that 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 what i found interesting writing a screenplay as opposed to writing a novel is not the obvious thing , which is having to pare everything down and find the kind of essence , the skeleton if you like , which can then be fleshed out by performance and cinematography 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 that , of course , you have to do 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 but i think the thing that 's really different and very interesting is that when you 're writing for the screen , you have to be hyper - conscious every moment of how the audience is going to react 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 if you write just one scene where the audience is confused or it breaks their concentration in some way , then you 've lost them , and you might never get them back 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 you 're really thinking all the time of what you have to do to make sure that they have the information that they need , that the emotional thread is not snapped , that the story moves at the right speed , to keep the audience hopefully sitting on the edge of their seats or else weeping or laughing 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 any of those is good 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : you narrate the film 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 that 's interesting , because you have n't chosen to record many of the audio versions of your books 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : i 've done bits -- " @entity170 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 " i did my collection of short stories , but it 's not the same thing , you know 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity175 is a very different thing than performing 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 in fact , one of the things i think that does n't work in books on tape is if the person doing the reading " acts " too much ; it becomes irritating to you listening to it 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 so reading is a different place , a different voice , and ( " @entity9 " ) after all was not me reading the book ; it was me performing the part of the older @entity193 looking back at his younger life 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 it 's a first - person narrative , first - person voiceover , and it 's his first person , not mine 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 so this involved a tiny bit of acting 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : most people do n't like the sound of their own voice 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 how was that for you 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : well , i was really worried because one of the things i felt is the real strength of the film is that we have a wonderful cast which turns in wonderful performances , and i did n't want to be the one who did n't 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i did n't want to be like the amateur amongst a group of great professionals , and that worried me 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 one of the things i know about @entity30 is that she is a great director of non-professional actors 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 she 's really good at guiding you at what to do -- a bit faster , a bit slower , a bit more of this and a bit less of that -- and i think all you have to do is be good at taking the direction and responding to it 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i told her that if i was embarrassed by the results , i would want to fire myself and find an actor , but in the end , people seemed to like it , so it stayed in 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : the film has played in @entity22 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 what was the reaction like 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity240 : it was very emotional to take it there , particularly showing it in @entity245 , which is where i was born and raised 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 ( it ) is the great movie city and , in many ways , is the city out of whose spirit the novel was born 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 to take the movie back did feel like closing a big circle 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i think @entity22 audiences reacted very emotionally to it 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 they loved it 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 there was a moment we showed it at the @entity261 , and when in the film the emergency rule period -- the authoritarian period of mrs	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity26 's sort of semi-dictatorship in the mid- ' 70s -- comes to an end , there 's a line in the voiceover where i say , " the emergency was over 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 " people in the theaters jumped to their feet , started applauding , because it meant that much to them , too 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : do you think " @entity9 " will play in @entity278 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : i doubt it , truthfully 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 it has been invited to the film festival in @entity282 in @entity283 , so it seems like that 's not a problem 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 and it 's already opened in a number of countries with very large @entity291 populations : it 's been played in @entity293 , and i think it 's due to open very soon in @entity295 and @entity296 , so it 's getting around 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity278 , i do n't know 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity278 's a mess 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity0 : i know you met @entity300 late in his life 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 there have been some wonderful adaptations of his books by the late @entity306 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 when you look at films adapted from great novels , do any come to your mind that were particularly successful 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity1 : i actually have taught a course in that at @entity314 , where i have a part - time professorship 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i think you could name certainly the ones you mentioned : @entity306 's adaptations of @entity300 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 actually , i thought @entity320 's adaptation of @entity322 's " @entity321 " was really very successful 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i really thought it was a wonderful film 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i think one of the great examples is @entity327 's film of " @entity328 , " a great @entity330 novel , which is actually one of the films we thought a lot about ( in making " @entity9 " ) because it does something that we were also trying to do , which is to take big historical events -- revolution in @entity330 -- and against that quite epic background , set the intimate story of a particular family 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 i think actually @entity342 's film of @entity344 ' great novel " @entity343 " is pretty successful 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 @entity346 's film of @entity348 's story " @entity349 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
 " i mean , i think you can find a best - case scenario in which the film does just fine compared to the book 	it is @placeholder 's first screenplay , and he narrates the film
