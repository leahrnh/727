@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 has apologized , which is the right thing to do when you do something wrong 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 yet i ca n't accept his apology , since i still have n't figured out what the champion golfer did that was so wrong 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 let me tee up this story 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 my fellow @entity0 - area resident has been thinking a lot about taxes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 and he 's done some of his thinking out loud 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 two weeks ago , during a conference call with reporters , the golfer made a passing reference to being concerned about " what 's gone on the last few months politically 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " last week , another reporter asked @entity2 to elaborate and he said : " there are going to be some drastic changes for me because i happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state , and it does n't work for me right now 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 so i 'm going to have to make some changes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " it seems that the @entity30 native is thinking about leaving the @entity31 and heading somewhere more welcoming to high - income earners 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 that 's it : @entity2 hinted that he might move his family to another state 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 and he got hammered for it 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 what does he think this is -- a free country 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the golfer claims that he pays about 60 % of his income in combined local , state , and federal taxes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 that figure seems impossibly high at first 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 but -- as an article in @entity47 pointed out -- with a new federal tax rate of 39	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
6 % on income over $ 450,000 , and a top state tax rate in @entity30 of 12	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
3 % on income above $ 1 million , and a 1 % state surcharge for mental health on income above $ 1 million , and a 3	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
8 % state surcharge for @entity56 on earnings above $ 250,000 , @entity2 's tax bill adds up in a hurry 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the article estimates that @entity2 's tax rate is closer to 53 % 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 but the golfer was talking about taxes in the broadest possible sense 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 you should also factor in the @entity72 taxes shouldered by the self - employed , the property taxes he pays to @entity64 for his home in the ritzy enclave of @entity67 , where homes can cost $ 15 million , and any municipal taxes he pays to @entity73 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 in 2012 , @entity2 earned about $ 60 million , most of it from product endorsements 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 let 's say that he earns the same amount in 2013 , and assume that he pays at least 50 % of his income in taxes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 that would mean @entity2 's tax bill for next year would ring up at about $ 30 million 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 that would leave him about $ 30 million after taxes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 whatever the exact amount of taxes that @entity2 is paying , it 's hard to feel sorry for someone with those sorts of earnings when the rest of us would love to have those problems 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the backlash was significant enough for @entity2 -- no doubt at the urging of his fleet of lawyers , accountants , managers , agents and public relations specialists -- to call for a mulligan 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 he issued a mea culpa just one day later 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " finances and taxes are a personal matter , and i should not have made my opinions on them public , " @entity2 said in a statement 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " i apologize to those i have upset or insulted , and assure you i intend not to let it happen again 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " i hate that he apologized 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 i suppose that part of it has to do with my job description 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 as an opinion writer , i upset people all the time 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 i 've been known to offend more people before breakfast than some people do all day 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 but since when did @entity124 have the right to life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness -- and the right to never be offended by something that someone else says 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 which brings us to what this story is really about 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 it 's not about taxes that are so high that bank robbers should ask the tax collector for lessons , or politicians who try to pay for runaway spending meant to ingratiate them with constituents by " soaking the rich , " or how the wealthy have no right to complain about paying taxes 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 all this is a sideshow 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the story of how " @entity2 " wound up in a rhetorical sand trap is all about freedom of expression 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 it 's about freedom of speech 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 it 's about freedom -- period 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 how ironic that this story broke the same week that president @entity160 , in his second inaugural address , talked about how " while freedom is a gift from @entity164 , it must be secured by his people here on @entity167 " and how , as @entity124 , " our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom " and how we should " answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " where did @entity2 's freedom go 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the story of the golfer and his taxes is , first and foremost , about being free to have your say even when it -- oh dear 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 -- offends someone 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 or , in this case , when it 's politically inconvenient for the tax - and - spend crowd to hear 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 to their ears , this kind of talk is subversive 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 if the " super wealthy " complain about paying taxes , before you know it , the " wealthy " will decide their taxes are too high as well 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 then it 'll spread to the merely " well - to - do 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " that 's why these outbursts have to be nipped in the bud 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 in the end , this story is less about what @entity2 pays in taxes than the price the entire country is paying for our oversensitivity whenever someone says something controversial 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 it 's about where we have arrived in this country -- where we 've convinced ourselves that we 're entitled to go through life never having to confront an opinion on any subject that is different from the ones we hold 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 a couple of years ago , i heard from a reader who said : " you know , i used to agree with much of what you wrote , and i looked forward to reading your column 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 but lately , we just disagree too much , so i 'm going to stop reading 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 " that 's one way to go 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 we can all follow suit and surround ourselves only with opinions we agree with 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 but let 's not kid ourselves 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 wherever that road leads , it is n't to a better and more enlightened society 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 @entity2 does n't owe us an apology 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 we owe him one 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 	@placeholder : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
