 @entity5 and @entity6 took little @entity7 to their gp 's surgery when the normally active girl started to wheeze and struggle for breath in february this year , but were told she had a cold or chest infection 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 they took their daughter back to the same doctor four times within four weeks but every time were sent away from @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , with nothing more than antibiotics 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 cancer : @entity25 and @entity26 took daughter @entity7 , two , ( pictured left with sister @entity28 , five , right ) to their gp four times but were told each time she had a cold or chest infection when @entity7 developed a lump on her neck in march the concerned parents phoned the surgery and spoke to another gp who said the lump was not serious 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 but the lump grew bigger and when @entity7 's left side shrank and turned blue at a family party the couple rushed @entity7 to @entity42 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 a chest x-ray showed there was something seriously wrong with the toddler and doctors suspected she had a collapsed lung 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 but when @entity7 was transferred to @entity51 in @entity52 , where she spent two weeks in intensive care , she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 @entity7 was then transferred to the @entity56 in @entity52 where doctors told the devastated couple that her lymph nodes in her neck were so inflamed that her wind pipe had been pushed an inch to the side - constricting her breathing 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 chemotherapy : after two weeks in intensive care @entity7 is back home but faces another two - and - a - half years of cancer treatment the couple , from @entity20 , @entity21 , who also have another daughter @entity28 , five , are considering taking legal action against the gp practice , but for now are concentrating on @entity7 's care 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 surveyor father @entity5 , 33 , said : ' as parents you know your children really well so my wife and i noticed when @entity7 was not herself 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' @entity7 is a really active and cheeky child and was walking from about eight months so when she refused to walk up the stairs like she normally would we knew she was not well 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' but we are not medical experts so we had no idea what was wrong with her 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 she was wheezing and struggling to breathe so at first we thought she might have a chest infection 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' but after the same doctor saw us at the doctors four times in about four weeks you would expect to be sent for an x-ray 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' the gp should have sent @entity7 for further tests to be on the safe side 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 we feel frustrated that they did not take her condition more seriously 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' when @entity7 developed this lump on her neck and my wife rang the doctors they just said ' if it is not purple and pulsating then is nothing serious 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' ' you have to believe the doctors , they are the experts 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' @entity5 battled and beat skin cancer himself after being diagnosed the day before @entity7 was born 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 he added : ' nothing can really prepare you for being told your child has cancer 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 but at least now we know what is wrong with @entity7 and we can concentrate on getting her better 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' @entity25 , 31 , who works part time for a surveyors , said : ' we had no idea how serious it was 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 we were reassured that everything would be fine 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' i 'd never want another parent to go through this 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
 ' @entity7 , who is now back home , will have to undergo treatment - including chemotherapy - for two and a half years 	@entity5 and @entity6 rushed @placeholder to hospital when she turned blue
