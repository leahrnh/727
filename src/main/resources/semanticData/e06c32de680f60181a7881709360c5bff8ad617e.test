 " we 've made clear from the beginning that the department intends to work with the committee to answer legitimate questions , " @entity49 said 	@placeholder issues a subpoena relating to @entity9
 " however , this subpoena shows that chairman @entity28 is more interested in generating headlines than in real oversight important to the @entity27 people 	@placeholder issues a subpoena relating to @entity9
 " @entity9 involved agents from the @entity59 allowing illegal sales of guns , believed to be destined for @entity64 drug cartels , to " walk " from @entity66 gun stores into @entity64 	@placeholder issues a subpoena relating to @entity9
