@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- three weeks and about 400 miles ago , i started a trip down the " most endangered " river in the @entity5 , @entity7 's @entity6 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 the underloved river is born in the @entity9 and snakes across one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world , @entity7 's @entity13 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i finished that journey -- which mostly involved kayaking , but also a fair bit of walking , since the @entity6 runs dry for about 40 miles -- on friday beneath the @entity18 here in @entity0 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 it was a moment i 'll always remember : that behemoth , cardinal - red bridge towering overhead , clanging in the wind , the distant roar of traffic , water rushing through a 1	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
7 - mile channel that drains about 40 % of this country - sized state 's land area 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 the ocean tossed the kayak around like a piece of dough 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 thirty - five mph winds seared salt water to my face , and tears of joy ran down my cheeks 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 it was thrilling but also bittersweet 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i knew that not a single drop of @entity6 water made it to the bridge , which should be the end of the river 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 all of it -- 100 % -- is diverted for a variety of human uses , mostly for farming 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 as i crossed under the bridge , which separates the @entity55 from the @entity56 , my thoughts were as choppy as the water 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 but between " do n't flip 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 " and " @entity58 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 " i looked up at the bridge and remembered a moment from my june 11 hike at the headwaters of the @entity6 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i could hear the river rumbling down in a valley to the left on that mountain trail , and i said something to my hiking companion , @entity69 -- a pro kayaker who goes careening off 80 - foot waterfalls like it 's no big thing -- about how , to me , the river sounded like a highway 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 no , he said , it 's the opposite 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 highways sound like rivers 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 that 's so true 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 and it really clicked for me in that moment 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 after three weeks on the river , i was finally starting to see things from the water 's perspective 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 @entity87 , of course , are the original highways 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 the roaring traffic above on the @entity90 reminded me of the @entity6 in its early , healthy stretches 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 but for most of us , traffic is far more familiar 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 we 've become a people disconnected from the water 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 we do n't know rivers 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 we do n't know where they start , where they 're going , when they 're full , why they 're dry 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 we do n't know enough to understand why -- long after the @entity106 era -- they still shape our lives , they 're still worthy of our attention and unyielding respect 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i hope this trip is part of a much broader effort to change that 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 to tilt our collective thinking toward a focus on water , and its great shepherds , the rivers 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i could go on for many more paragraphs about the journey -- about the farmers , bird - lovers , migrant workers , fish biologists , dam operators , boat nuts and barefoot skiers i met along the way 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
 i 'll do that at a later date as part of our @entity133 project 	the @placeholder travels through rich agricultural land in @entity7 -- and it runs dry
