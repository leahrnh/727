( @entity0 ) -- the complex architecture of the human brain and how its billions of nerve cells communicate has baffled the greatest minds for centuries 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 but now , new technology is allowing neuroscientists to map the brain 's connections in ever - greater detail 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 the creation of a map , or " connectome " as it has been dubbed , is raising hopes that brain disorders like autism and schizophrenia will be better understood in the future , perhaps cured 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , a @entity23 government - funded scheme , recently began trials on healthy volunteers with a state - of - the - art diffusion - imaging scanner 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 built by @entity31 engineering company @entity30 , it works by tracking the passage of water molecules through nerve fibers , giving a more accurate picture of the brain 's structure and its neuronal pathways , scientists say 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " the diffusion image is a map of the water diffusion which we then convert into a marker for the fiber pathways , " says @entity39 , director of @entity40 at the @entity41 at @entity42 ( @entity42 ) 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " we then reconstruct it through computer algorithms that explain the water diffusion that we have observed 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " more from @entity52 : the credit - card sized $ 35 pc from the outside , the scanner looks like a conventional mri machine but the power inside enables it to produce images more than 10 times clearer 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " it 's the difference between looking at the bonnet ( of a car ) and looking at the gears and belts inside , " @entity39 said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 the idea , he says , is to dispose the brain to a coordinates system 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " think of the difference of making maps before longitude and latitude versus making maps after , " he said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 data from the scanner is still being refined but @entity77 and his colleague @entity78 are excited about its potential 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " over time , it 's clear that in addition to scanning normal volunteers we 'd be very interested in scanning patients with disease , " says @entity78 , director of the @entity80 at @entity42 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " the tools we are developing , as well as many other scientists around the world mapping these brain circuits , may be fundamental to how we understand and conceptualize diseases and treat them , " he added 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " once you understand that it 's an abnormality of specific circuits it gives you clues in terms of the pharmacology you want use to use depending on the part of the brain 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " poorly understood diseases like autism , he says , could be the result of an abnormality of brain connections called " connectopathies 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " " hopefully , we 'll be in a position to see if that 's true or not 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 and if it is , try to understand where it came from and try to fix it , " @entity78 said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 @entity112 , a neuroscientist at @entity113 agrees 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " researchers have conjectured that the neurons themselves are healthy but maybe they are just wired together in an abnormal way 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 but we 've never had the technology to test that hypothesis until now , " @entity112 said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 @entity112 's own work in this area is focused on exploring individual neurons ( something the @entity20 scanner can not do ) , painstakingly building up three - dimensional maps of neurons taken from the retina of dead mice 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 in his new book , " @entity129 : how the @entity133 , " @entity112 argues that our identities are stored in the connections between individual brain cells 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " i believe connectomes are the meeting ground for nature and nurture 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 the gene controls how the brain wires up , but experiences also modify the connections of the brain , " he said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " i 'm interested in why we are unique 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 what is the source of our uniqueness 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 i believe the differences between people are going to be , in large part , down to the differences in neuro - connectomes 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " but the task of mapping human neurons is enormous when compared to the mapping of say , the human genome , he says 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " the complete neural connectome of a human has a billion times more connections than a genome has letters , " @entity112 said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 and only one organism 's connectome -- the one millimeter - long worm @entity164 -- is known in its entirety , says @entity112 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 but its 300 neurons and 7,000 connections took @entity171 researchers over a decade to complete during the 1970s and 1980s 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 humans have around 100 billion neurons 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " the brain is so complex , so do we have a prayer of figuring it out 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " @entity112 said 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 " i would argue the fundamental limitation has been technological so far 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
 but i would say that once we can observe what 's happening in the brain at the appropriate resolution then we have a chance 	@placeholder shedding new light on connectivity and function
