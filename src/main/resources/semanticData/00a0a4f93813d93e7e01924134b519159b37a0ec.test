by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 08:47 est , 7 july 2013 @entity2 ’s hopes of becoming prime minister have received a major boost after former foreign secretary @entity5 hailed him as ‘ the new @entity6 ’ 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 a new book by the @entity9 grandee mocks the way ‘ every @entity12 leader ’ – and @entity13 – since @entity6 has tried to associate themselves with the @entity17 prime minister ’s ‘ @entity19 ’ brand of politics 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 but he argues that the only one who can lay claim to be a modern @entity6 is mr @entity2 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 while the @entity25 mayor may be delighted by the comparison , @entity5 ’s comments are double - edged 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 @entity27 : @entity6 and @entity2 have a number of similarities , according to @entity5 he says @entity6 ’s greatness derives not from political achievements or principles , but from character and wit 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 furthermore , writes @entity5 , mr @entity38 shares @entity36 ’s reputation for ‘ wicked ’ behaviour with women and telling the truth 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ‘ according to accepted wisdom on modern politics , @entity2 should have been ruined years ago 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 he has been accused of all kinds of conventional wickedness , including being unfaithful and insulting the people of @entity47 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 and yet his reputation has soared 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 argument : the former foreign secretary believes that mr @entity2 can capture @entity6 's appeal ‘ @entity2 gets away with it because he is entertaining and makes good use of his education 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 of course , there is a question of control 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 while @entity6 tried to keep his comedy in check and did not let his wit gallop away with him , @entity2 allows himself to be consumed by his own jokes 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 this makes it difficult when he wants to make a serious point 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ’ however , he concludes : ‘ but , one way or another , @entity2 has nonetheless done today what @entity6 did in the 19th century , namely raise the level of interest in politics up several pegs 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ’ lord @entity5 ’s book , @entity36 : or the two lives , studies how @entity75 @entity17 ’s favourite prime minister established a permanent hold on the @entity9 despite being a ‘ bankrupt @entity78 school dropout and trashy novelist ’ 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 he writes : ‘ he held few principles which he was not ready to alter for the sake of immediate tactical gain 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ‘ moreover , in @entity6 ’s personal life , the negative side of the ledger is piled particularly high 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 he married for money after abandoning women who adored him 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ‘ if @entity6 were alive today he would despair at the lack of courage and bravery among our political classes 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 these days we are subjected to parliamentary performances that border on banal 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
 ’ mr @entity38 is ‘ the most prominent exception who proves the rule ’ , says @entity5 	@placeholder says @entity25 mayor can channel @entity6 's popular charm
