( @entity0 ) -- while there is still a lot of talk about how the @entity5 needs to reinvent itself , @entity1 should keep in mind they could use a touch - up themselves 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 with 20 @entity9 seats to defend in the midterm election -- compared with just 13 @entity5 ones -- the truth is sen	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 @entity13 and the gang do not have a lot of time to gloat 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 the economy may be improving , but it is still limping ; millions are looking for work , and the deficit continues to grow 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 so whatever momentum president @entity21 and the @entity1 received from last week 's victories will all be gone come 2016 if they ca n't agree on a detailed budget plan by 2014 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 and let 's be clear : taxing the rich and closing some loopholes is not a detailed plan 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 granted , @entity1 are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 the latter got them elected but the economy is in more need of the former 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 allowing the @entity37 tax cuts to expire for those who make $ 1 million a year or more , as championed by some , is estimated to generate only $ 500 billion to $ 600 billion over 10 years 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 that dwarfs the number cutting off @entity42 would bring but it does little to solve the debt problem 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 opinion : conservatives , do n't despair so any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 if @entity1 want to build on last week , they have to be bold , because they ca n't depend on republicans to say stupid things about rape or ignore minorities forever 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 in fact , confetti was still falling in @entity55 when @entity37 -- the @entity57 speaking , half - @entity58 nephew of you know who -- filed his papers with the @entity62 to run for an as - yet unspecified office 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 the 36 - year - old is the co-founder of the political action committee , @entity66 @entity5 of @entity67 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 that alone wo n't solve all of the party 's image problems with @entity71 , but as long as he 's not on the crazy , inflammatory side of his party , he 's got the looks , charisma and name to be the kind of political star they need -- the kind who can draw big crowds and maybe sway @entity66 voters two years from now , if not for himself , then certainly for another @entity5 candidate 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 face it @entity1 -- the celebration is over and it 's time to get to work 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 at least six of the @entity9 seats the party has to defend are in red states 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 lose those , and president @entity21 could be spending his final two years butting heads with a @entity92 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 so what do the @entity1 need to do 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 opinion : election a call for purple politics well for starters , identify candidates to go after @entity102 @entity101 sen	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 @entity101 ' seat , because @entity21 won @entity102 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 second , be a party white people want to vote for 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 lost in all of the hoopla about @entity5 needing to adapt to the country 's new demographic , is the fact @entity109 captured the largest percentage of white votes since @entity112 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 true , some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to @entity21 -- but most of it has to do with the message of the @entity1 platform 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 @entity109 characterized 47 % of the country as a bunch of moochers ( and coincidentally came away with 47	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
8 % of the popular vote ) 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 that means a lot of voters : the numbers suggest 88 % of the people who voted for @entity109 were white 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 that 's a problem 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 if @entity1 do n't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people , they could possibly lose the @entity9 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 and third , and probably most important , they have to be a party worth voting for 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 one can certainly say @entity5 , from the top of the ticket on down , shot themselves in the foot this election , making it easier for @entity1 to paint them as a party to vote against 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 but for the 2014 midterm , @entity1 must present a budget plan people want to vote for 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 in two years voters are going to be asking " what else you got 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 " and if @entity1 do n't have an answer , they risk getting shellacked in 2014 , the same way they got their butts handed to them in 2010 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 back then , republicans took back the @entity153 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 politics : 2014 battle for the @entity9 starts now another @entity5 landslide could create a path to the @entity153 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
 i hate to be the @entity159 at your @entity161 party , but it is what it is 	@placeholder : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that relies more on spending cuts
