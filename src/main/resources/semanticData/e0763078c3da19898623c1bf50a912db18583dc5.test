( @entity0 ) -- physical attraction may be as old as time , but new studies are beginning to uncover the science behind sex appeal 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 unexpected factors -- like biochemical odors , face shape and voice pitch -- just might have more to do with your choice of mate than anyone ever expected 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 biostatistics expert @entity14 explains why actress @entity16 scored very high on facial attractiveness 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity18 and @entity19 are leading the research on the human scent 's influence on sexual attraction 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 they 've found that when women are ovulating , they produce copulins , a scent that attracts men 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 the researchers believe when a man gets a whiff of copulins , his testosterone levels rise 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 as a result , he secretes androstenone , an odor that repels women who are n't ovulating 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " bars and nightclubs across the world are the battlefield for this invisible biochemical war , " @entity38 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "

 @entity44 says attraction has a lot more to do with science and evolution than people might think 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " we are innately all puppies in heat , " she says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " we are capable of discerning 10,000 different scents consciously 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 but then there 's a whole realm of unconscious scents that we 're not even aware that we 're smelling 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " @entity0 : get dr	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity44 's 5 steps to better sex these odors let people know when a woman is fertile and when a man 's testosterone levels are high , @entity44 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 as a result , individuals can tell when someone else is most ripe for reproduction 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " it 's all about survival of the species , " she says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 one common complaint @entity44 hears among women with relationship problems is that they love their partner , but they 're not in love with him 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " there is a difference between love and chemistry , " @entity44 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " take a really good whiff of him without cologne when he 's relatively clean 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 if that smell turns you on , that 's a really good cue of chemistry 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " @entity0 : can the chemistry come later 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 in one recent study , @entity44 says , researchers had women smell men 's t - shirts 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 the women were most attracted to the shirts of men with a different major histocompatability complex ( @entity98 ) from them 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity98 is a collection of genes that are related to immune systems 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " we unconsciously want to mate with someone who has a different immune system than ours because that helps with the survival of our offspring , " @entity44 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 the t - shirt study also found that women taking hormonal contraception were attracted to men who had similar @entity98 as they did 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " if you 're on the pill , your body is being tricked into think you 're pregnant , so you 're not ovulating , " @entity44 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " the bad news there is that they have looked at these couples who have similar @entity98 , and not only do they have higher levels of infidelity and higher levels of marital discord , but they also have higher infertility issues 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " another unexpected factor that has been found to directly affect attraction is voice pitch 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity127 , @entity128 , a professor at the @entity129 at @entity130 , says that women with higher estrogen levels have higher voices , which makes them more desirable to men 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " when females are midcycle , when they 're the most fertile , the most likely to conceive , their voices are rated as being significantly more attractive , " he says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 it 's hard to pinpoint what distinguishes a gorgeous face from an average one , but some researchers are getting pretty close 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 psychologist @entity142 , @entity128 , of the @entity143 in @entity144 says she 's found that women 's faces get more attractive to men when they are ovulating 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " we 're not entirely clear why there 's this difference , but we think that the women might look healthier , have a bit of a healthier glow when they are ovulating 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " symmetry is another factor that determines a face 's attractiveness 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity14 , an assistant professor of biostatistics at the @entity160 , says there is a formula for the " perfect " face 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 she uses 29 different measurements to determine someone 's appeal on a scale of 1 to 10 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 to start , @entity168 says the ratio of the length of the face to the width of the face should be 1	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
6 , also known as the golden ratio 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " the face should also be divided into three equal pieces vertically , " she says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " the forehead , then [ the bottom of the forehead to ] the nose and then from the nose to the chin 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " who 's face is the most " perfect , " according to @entity168 's measurements 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 no big surprise here 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "

 " he was a 9	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
3 [ out of 10 ] 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " @entity188 's partner , @entity191 , did n't fare too badly either 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " @entity191 was a 7	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
67 , and that 's pretty high , " @entity168 says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " most people rate about 4 to 6 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 the thing that is probably lowering her score is the thing that she 's most famous for -- her full lips 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " @entity168 says that ideally the width of a mouth should be twice the height of the lips 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "

 " not everything that goes into finding a partner is biological 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 researchers have also found that if a woman looks at the face of a man whom she knows nothing about , she will give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 that 's different than if she is shown the same face and a corresponding income 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 when a man makes a lot of money , a woman will rate him higher on an attractiveness scale than she would that same man with a smaller income 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity0 : what do women really want 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 @entity44 says this is n't a case of women being gold diggers 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " it goes back again to evolution 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 when we were having babies who were very dependent on us , we could n't hunt and take care of ourselves , so we were looking for the man who had the most social status , who was the best hunter , who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies , " she says 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
 " it 's the same thing today 	sex therapist dr. @placeholder : " we are innately all puppies in heat "
