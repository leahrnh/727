 " eighteen months in prison is too much , " said @entity11 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 he is representing @entity13 , a @entity4 living in east @entity0 who admitted pretending to be a single @entity17 man before having sex with an @entity20 woman 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 @entity13 already has been detained for two months , followed by about two years of house arrest , his lawyer said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " according to the bargain , he should be punished , but we expect him to receive community service on appeal in about 30 days ' time , " @entity11 added 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 @entity13 told @entity1 the relations with the woman , who has not been identified publicly , were consensual 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " the girl is the one who started flirting with me and talking to me , and she is the one who wanted the thing from beginning to end , " he said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " i met her on a @entity0 street , she approached me and started flirting with me 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 within 15 minutes , she wanted to be with me , and we were together 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " @entity11 described his client 's liaison in more detail : " there was a short foreplay a few minutes before ; during the foreplay , the guy tells a few lies , the lady tells a few lies 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 they both have one goal , and that is to go to bed together 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 after the sexual intercourse , which was totally consensual , the lady decides to claim that the guy raped her brutally 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 she comes to court and testifies that this was a case of rape in which there was the use of force 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " at this stage , the defense decides to make an independent investigation 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 the investigation came up with new facts upon which the @entity63 [ district attorney ] decides to give up the claim the sex was not consensual 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 so both sides agreed that the sexual intercourse was consensual 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 however , the @entity63 still wanted to charge him with rape by deception 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " so this is the best the defense could do in this case 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 we are appealing the very long sentence 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " @entity13 , who acknowledged having told the woman he was single , said he is known as " @entity78 , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 , " but also his own nickname 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " apparently , later she discovered that i was an @entity84 and complained to the police , " he said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " i did not say anything or commit anything wrong , " he insisted , adding that he did not understand how his misrepresentations could result in a rape charge 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " if i told the woman i was a pilot and later she finds out that i was not a pilot , then she goes and says that ' he raped me ' 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 if i told her that i was a millionaire and it turns out that i am a poor man , then she goes and says that ' he raped me ' 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " " it is terrible , but the law says very clearly that if someone has sexual intercourse using deception about his identity to conduct the act , it can be considered rape , " said @entity96 , a lawyer specializing in civil rights and human rights cases 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 but , if the circumstances had been different -- if a religious jew had said he was not religious in order to woo a potential suitor -- " he would not be brought to court , " she said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " and i am not sure that , on this occasion , it is a reason to charge 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 to have intercourse in daytime in a deserted building in the center of town -- i say the circumstances speak for themselves 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " she added , " the thing that interests me in the case is the need , the necessity , of @entity84 in @entity20 to pretend 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 to speak without an accent so as not to be seen as @entity84 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 to dress not to look like @entity84 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " she predicted @entity13 would prevail 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " i do n't know if he will be acquitted , but he has served his punishment , " she said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 criminal law rarely applies to minor lies , like dyed hair or a changed name , " said @entity129 of the @entity130 for @entity131 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " but it would apply to the more meaningful lies , " she said 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " for example , where a doctor persuades a woman to have sex claiming it would be a part of the medical treatment 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 as for this particular case , it is not the fact that he was an @entity84 and claimed to be @entity17 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 the court emphasized the fact that he claimed to be single while he was married , which would be relevant in the context of a romantic relationship 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " @entity13 expressed regret , but not for the alleged victim 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " i would only be upset and regret this because i have put my wife through pain and upset her , but i did not [ do ] anything wrong with the girl 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 " his is the second conviction on the charge of rape by deception 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
 in 2008 , the @entity20 @entity165 convicted @entity166 for impersonating an official in the @entity168 and promising women help and benefits to persuade them to have sex with him 	@entity13 says he 's known as " @placeholder , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 "
