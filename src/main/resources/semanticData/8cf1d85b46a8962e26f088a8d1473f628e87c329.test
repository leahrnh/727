( @entity1 ) it wo n't come as news to anyone in @entity4 today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority ( initial stop and question , pulling someone over for a traffic violation ) becomes significant because of the potential result ( deadly force ) 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 a minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 an initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 and an arrest , we know , can have fatal results 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 in @entity27 earlier this month , @entity26 was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 but failure to pay child support is not a crime 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 at least , not in the traditional sense , though states do criminalize it 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 it 's rightly a civil matter 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 this raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 not all " warrants " are created equal 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 sometimes there are warrants for arrest , which are issued for alleged murders , drug dealing or sexual assault 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 then there are cases like the @entity26 case 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 do n't get me wrong 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well - being today 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 forget the school - to - prison - pipeline 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 lousy parents are the prison pipeline ; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 first , it 's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court 's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 yes , parents who ca n't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts , but once the courts and law enforcement are involved , they do things their way 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 and it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 @entity27 family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 oftentimes and sadly so , papa is a rolling stone , and he falls behind on his payments 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 when a supporting parent has fallen behind , the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 at the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he 's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well - established language of support shirkers 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he 's too poor to pay his child 's support 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 if he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 what follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon , a game show and debtor 's prison 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 the defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 if he ca n't , he 'll be stuck in jail until he does pay 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 and let 's face it : while it 's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads , jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to , you guessed it , earn money to pay that debt 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 of course , since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant , dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates " mixed up 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 " the court 's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 that warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant , but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on monday 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 the point is this : some warrants are for the arrest of criminals 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 those are the warrants we 're familiar with , from " @entity178 " and every other cop show 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 other warrants , like those for contempt of a support order , have nothing to do with crime 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 they 're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 yet we 've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 that 's right , the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 when they run a driver 's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up , those same police who are armed with @entity205 and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 not because he 's dangerous 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 not because he 's a criminal 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 because he 's ( breathtakingly ) financially irresponsible 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 @entity26 might have run because he knew the drill 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 he knew he was going to be arrested 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 he should n't have run 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 but he also definitely should n't have been shot 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 if he owed $ 18,000 in arrears , he definitely should n't have been looking to buy a @entity214 , as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 but whether or not he ran , the result would have been the same : if he had a bench warrant , he was going to jail , by force if necessary , even though he does not appear to have committed a " crime 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 " of course , the counterargument is : if we do n't arrest them , how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 there 's no easy answer 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 but the better question may be : why do we as a society not shun parents who do n't take care of their kids 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution , and one that could be solved with less government intrusion , and more community involvement 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 the @entity26 situation has highlighted some harsh truths 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 if we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads , we ca n't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 while no one should be shot for failure to pay support , we 're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force , empowered to use deadly force , to aid in collecting these bills 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 if we are , then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 and if we 're comfortable with that , then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase , and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 then , our only defense is to watch 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 and record 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
 note : an earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime 	@placeholder was killed by a @entity27 police officer in april
