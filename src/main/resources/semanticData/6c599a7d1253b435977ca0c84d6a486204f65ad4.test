( @entity0 ) are we alone in the cosmos 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 or might there be intelligent life elsewhere 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 last week , @entity6 scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 this year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun , @entity17 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 since then , ground - based surveys and @entity6 's @entity20 satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed " exoplanets , " and thousands more candidates await confirmation 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 some have large planets like @entity30 that orbit their stars far closer than @entity32 , the innermost planet in our solar system 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 but smaller rocky planets like @entity37 , though harder to find , appear to be even more abundant 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 life on @entity37 developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 that suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 life as we know it is carbon - based and requires liquid water 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 astronomers define the " habitable zone " around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet 's surface 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 any closer to the star , the water will boil into vapor ; any farther and the water freezes into ice 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 extrapolating from discoveries to date , astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion @entity37 - like , habitable - zone planets in our @entity65 galaxy alone 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 of course , there is a difference between single - celled organisms -- which developed 3	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals , which appeared about 200 million years ago 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 and then the humans , who have existed for only 200,000 years 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on @entity37 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 so while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen , the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did , with ears and spoken language , or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 and life that can use radio waves has existed on @entity37 for only 0	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
000002 % of the planet 's history -- 100 years out of 4	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
5 billion 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 if the half dozen or so rocky , @entity37 - like exoplanets now known are similar , the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as , well , winning your state lottery with one ticket 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 of course , if there are 40 billion @entity37 - like planets out there , the odds improve quite a bit 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 if they all have histories like the @entity37 's , there might be 1,000 planets in the @entity65 that could support communicative beings 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 but before you start composing your first letter to an alien , think about this : the chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 another planet 's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago , or it might happen a billion years in the future 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 a lot depends on how long communication capabilities last 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 so the duration of the @entity129 on a planet could be short 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 not to mention : the average light - travel - time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years , so unless humans evolve to be ageless , we 're not exchanging ims with aliens anytime soon 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 if advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more , the chances of communicating with them are not negligible 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 but in that case , they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are ( since they developed the capability far earlier than we did ) -- so if they wanted us to know they exist , would n't they simply tell us 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 the @entity150 project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules , the building blocks of life , in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen - rich atmosphere , such as that created by the first bacteria on @entity37 , or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 @entity6 's @entity176 , to be launched in 2018 , will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky , habitable exoplanets 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 @entity6 's rovers have shown that @entity182 was once much more habitable 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 it had fresh - water lakes and streams of water running along its surface 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 some water still remains , and there may yet be life discovered on @entity182 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 new missions plan to look at @entity193 and @entity194 , moons of @entity30 that have liquid water below their icy surfaces 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @entity65 galaxy , is practically inevitable 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
 but the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years 	@entity216 : life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @placeholder galaxy , is practically inevitable
