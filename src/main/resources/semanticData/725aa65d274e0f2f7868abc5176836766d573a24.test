@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 is more than ready for @entity3 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 the former secretary of state confirmed on sunday what the political world has expected for months -- eight years after her first failed @entity9 bid , @entity4 will once again seek the @entity11 's nomination for president 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " i 'm hitting the road to earn your vote , because it 's your time , " @entity4 said in a video released sunday afternoon officially kicking off her campaign 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " and i hope you 'll join me on this journey 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " as @entity4 sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country , @entity0 elites are ready to roll out the red carpet 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for @entity4 's newly launched campaign , it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity4 , 67 , has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 as a @entity2 senator for almost a decade , she represented @entity0 and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 and there is a certain degree of nostalgia within the industry for her husband 's two - term presidency , marked by the 1990s bull market and broad financial deregulation , including the repeal of the @entity54 , which separated commercial banking from riskier investing activities 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 now @entity4 's allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in @entity2 and beyond 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 many on @entity0 and in the broader business community view her as a dependable , business - friendly force within a @entity11 that has grown increasingly populist during president @entity66 's time in office 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity68 , the former ceo of @entity69 and a close @entity66 associate who will back @entity4 in 2016 , said there 's an " incredible amount of enthusiasm " for her campaign to get off the ground 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " we know the secretary from the years of being first lady to the senator to the secretary , so we have decades of working relationship with her , " @entity68 , who now runs a boutique consulting firm headquartered in @entity77 , told @entity1 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " i do n't think it 's surprising that the former senator of @entity2 is close to the finance community 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " @entity4 friend and prominent @entity11 fundraiser @entity88 , who founded the venture capital firm @entity90 , said @entity4 has " an enormous following " both inside and outside of the finance world 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " there are a lot of people who perhaps did n't know her as well before who are all set to jump on the bandwagon , " @entity88 said 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 as compared with 2008 , he added : " there is no diminishment , just the opposite -- an acceleration of interest in her running for the presidency 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " but the fanfare wo n't sit well with everyone 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 the former first lady 's perceived coziness with @entity0 is a source of irritation for liberal activists , who hope to push the eventual @entity11 nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the 2016 primaries 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity4 , who lost her first presidential campaign to a challenger from the left , seems to recognize that the liberal wing of the party has grown even more vocal and influential since then , especially on economic matters 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 her video message on sunday centered on the theme of upward mobility and an economic recovery that has left some behind 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " @entity129 have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top , " @entity4 said , vowing to be a " champion " of " everyday @entity129 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " that statement tracks closely with her tone in recent public appearances , where the former secretary has been hitting on populist economic themes 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 she has taken on a range of issues that most appeal to liberals , such as the wealth gap , minimum wage and equal pay , in the months leading up to her announcement 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 in january , she took to social media to defend the 2010 @entity155 @entity0 reform law , which contains provisions that the industry has tried to roll back 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " attacking financial reform is risky and wrong , " she wrote on @entity158 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity160 , a longtime @entity4 ally and former @entity66 chief of staff , said @entity4 has to reintroduce herself to the party 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 if she defends policies viewed as having contributed to the financial crisis , @entity160 said , " that 's a problem 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " he continued : " my guess is she 'll have enough policy positions that says she 's not in the tank with them 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " @entity4 's early gestures have not satisfied some activists , who point to @entity177 @entity11 sen	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity176 as their candidate of choice 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 several liberal groups have even launched a formal draft campaign to elevate the senator and highlight her progressive views 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 former @entity186 @entity185 sen	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity184 , who served as head of the @entity188 , said part of @entity4 's challenge stems from the fact that " the center of the @entity11 has moved very much to the left 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " " @entity3 has always been much more rational on these issues and much more mainstream , " @entity184 said 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " i presume she 's going to get the nomination , but she may be contested from the left 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " while @entity197 has shown no interest in running for president this cycle , other democrats have been taking aim at big banks as they tour the early presidential states 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11

 @entity206 and @entity209 sen	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity208 , an independent who caucuses with @entity11 , are all testing the waters 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 they have made economic populism central to their potential campaigns , proposing to crack down on the banking sector , reform the culture on @entity0 and toughen financial regulations 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with @entity4 's extensive fundraising apparatus 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 but their presence in the race could exert pressure on @entity4 to embrace progressive policies 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 after @entity4 's announcement sunday , a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " we look forward to @entity3 and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity197 has spent her life leading , " said @entity197 campaign manager @entity233 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " in the coming days , @entity239 will be stepping up our efforts to convince @entity197 to run for president 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " now that she is a formally declared candidate , political strategists expect @entity4 to be more outspoken , laying out her economic priorities quickly and in her own terms 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity11 strategist @entity246 downplayed the notion of @entity4 - @entity197 tension in the @entity11 , predicting that with @entity4 as an announced candidate , " she 'll offer a pretty compelling rationale " for her campaign 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity246 , who worked in @entity254 's administration , said he envisioned an economic message for @entity4 anchored in her biography : " i grew up in the @entity258 in a middle class family , i understand the challenges that they face , we need to make sure that @entity129 gives people a fair shot 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " despite @entity4 's embrace of more populist rhetoric , finance and business leaders are n't too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 they expect that she will be able to articulate a broad economic goals aimed at the middle class rather than one that rails against bailouts and financial excess , particularly as the country gets more distance from the last financial crisis 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 @entity281 , president of the @entity282 , a prominent business coalition , predicted that @entity4 would be able to maintain her relationship with @entity0 without alienating the liberal base 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 the fact that @entity4 " is knowledgeable and maintains good , open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she 's in anybody 's pocket , " @entity281 said 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 " she 's demonstrated that she 's an independent force 	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
 "	her coziness with @placeholder irritates liberal activists , who are a growing influence in the @entity11
