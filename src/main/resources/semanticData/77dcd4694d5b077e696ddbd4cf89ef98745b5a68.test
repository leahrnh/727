( @entity1 ) @entity0 is no ordinary 21 - year - old 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 by day he is an industrial design student at @entity3 , but @entity0 has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 hanging in his workshop @entity0 has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 @entity0 has an @entity12 himself , @entity13 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 you might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery , but speaking to @entity17 is quick to explain how the transformation took place 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 @entity0 says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " previously i 'd been involved with costume making 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 i 'd made a version of the @entity24 from @entity26 's ' @entity25 ' and i really liked that suit , " @entity0 says 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 but , as elaborate as his design was , it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " i was frustrated every time i wore it , " @entity0 explains 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " it really limited my mobility and i did n't like that -- it did n't go with the character 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " in september 2014 he bit the bullet , deciding " to do another one that would n't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like @entity13 's actual suit 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " the @entity24 had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 striking such a balance required expensive materials , and they did n't come cheap 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 @entity0 therefore fired up a @entity55 campaign 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 he " did n't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it " -- he raised $ 1,255 in 6 days 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " it was a little surprising , " @entity0 demurs 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 writing out his shopping list , it was important that " everywhere , even places without armor plating , had some sort of protection 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " @entity65 was sourced as the base fabric , making it " cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons , but breathable and wearable all day 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " eschewing conventional materials , @entity0 opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to " squish and compress , " dissipating the impact of blows 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 after much experimenting with " polycarbonates and extruded pvc materials , " Â¼ " @entity79 ( or @entity80 ) plastic formed the tough armor plates , located on the torso , forearms and shins 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 stab resistant , @entity0 says " it can take anything but a gunshot 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " the cowl was more problematic , being " nearly impossible " to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 @entity0 therefore took a mold of his head using @entity96 plastic , " working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable @entity13 shape 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
 " using a two part box mold @entity0 was able to create a " silicone jacket " of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , " durable and functional " cowl 	made with money raised on @placeholder , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
