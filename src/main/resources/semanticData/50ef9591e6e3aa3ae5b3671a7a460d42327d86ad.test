 the 42 - year - old actress and star of the hit tv sitcom " @entity17 " split from businessman @entity16 in may 2014 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity16 is suing the @entity19 - born actress in @entity0 to prevent @entity5 from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in november 2013 , according to published reports by @entity24 and @entity26 magazine 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the lawsuit cited by the two publications , however , lists the plaintiff as " @entity30 " and the defendant as " @entity32 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " the suit does n't identify the names of the actual litigants 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 instead , the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals ' privacy 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 on tuesday , @entity16 's attorney @entity43 confirmed in a statement that @entity16 filed the lawsuit 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 representatives for @entity5 declined to comment 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged , and their plan was to eventually have children together 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 on " @entity17 , " @entity5 plays @entity52 , an eccentric and voluptuous @entity19 immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 but the sitcom make - believe is far from what @entity5 is dealing with now 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by @entity32 until both parties reach an agreement 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held , the @entity62 in @entity63 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the center did n't respond to a message seeking comment friday 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 according to the legal paperwork , the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers , one being a close friend of @entity32 's , in an attempt to have children 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 however , neither of the implantations was successful 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 in his own statement , @entity16 said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term , but he does n't want any money from the egg donor 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 his statement does n't directly identify @entity5 as the donor , other than referring to his " ex	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " " i have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex , and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future , should she change her mind , " @entity16 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 he believes that " life begins at fertilization , " he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations , even where a man does n't want to become a father 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 where a man does want to become a father , and wants to impose no obligations on the other party , he should have that corresponding right 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 however life comes to be created , it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent , " @entity16 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 in an interview with @entity118 in april 2013 , while the couple was still engaged , @entity5 spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " we just wanted to plan ahead 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 my boyfriend @entity16 is three years younger than me and he 's never had a son 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 i have my son , @entity125 , so it 's not that import ( ant ) 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 you know , it 's not like an emergency for me to have another kid 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 for @entity16 , yes , because he 's never had a baby , " @entity5 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 during the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with @entity16 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " i already froze some eggs so , you know , i wanted to take advantage of science 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 why not 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " @entity5 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the @entity118 anchor asked @entity5 how far along she was in the process , to which the actress replied : " i took them out already 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 they 're in a refrigerator 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " @entity146 , she added , " hopefully they 'll be fresh by the time i use them 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity159 , who 's not involved in this case 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , " he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , @entity159 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " the documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners , " he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " in the scenario where there 's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to , it will usually be decided by a court of law 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " but experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " religious , moral issues , to legal and contract issues 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 when does life begin 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 are these embryos alive 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " said @entity202 attorney @entity201 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " to @entity206 , for example , conception marks the beginning of life 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 to abortion advocates , the child has to be in a more advanced state , perhaps the third trimester , so it 's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues , " @entity201 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity201 said @entity16 has a case because no court in @entity202 will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " this case is a gray area of law because it 's new , " @entity201 said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " it 's developing as we speak , " he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " it 's a question , i think , of whether to decide if these frozen ( embryos ) are human beings or whether they are property 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 since they are unborn , some states in the @entity230 look at these ( embryos ) not as life , but as property 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " @entity201 said the lawsuit reportedly filed by @entity16 will now open new issues , and a @entity202 court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " these embryos are not inside her body , " he said 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in @entity63 , so there the @entity245 of @entity246 vs	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity248 case can not be used by the @entity5 team to allege that the ( embryos ) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 " in that case , the @entity230 @entity255 declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 the lawsuit comes as @entity5 promotes her new movie , " @entity262 , " with co-star @entity263 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity5 is now reportedly engaged to actor @entity264 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
 @entity1 's @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report 	@entity5 spoke of freezing embryos with @placeholder in a 2013 interview
