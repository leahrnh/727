( @entity0 ) -- imagine if a streetlamp knew you were coming 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 it could announce your arrival from a distance 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 if you were on a date , it could help set the mood 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 it could ring in the new year with dazzling effects , change color at will , even announce days in advance when its bulb was set to blow 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 in fact , there is nothing future - tense about this fantastical vision ; in a handful of municipalities in @entity21 , streetlights have become downright chatty 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 the system is called @entity23 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 it was invented by @entity26 designer @entity25 while a student at @entity28 in the @entity26 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 when flying overseas , he noticed streetlamps lighting streets that , in the middle of the night , were empty and desolate 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " i started researching , " he says 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " i wondered , why are they burning 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 how much does it cost 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 is this a problem 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 i discovered some amazing numbers 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " read more : 12 amazing designs from the past 100 years @entity25 found that @entity21 pays over â ‚ ¬ 10 billion ( $ 13 billion ) a year powering streetlights , which accounts for more than 40 % of government energy bills 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 this translates into 40 million tons of co2 emissions annually -- enough to power 20 million cars 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 his solution was to create an intelligent , " on - demand " lighting system using wireless sensors 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 streetlights only light up in the presence of a person , bicycle or car , and remain dim the rest of the time 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 @entity25 has also developed the technology to distinguish between people and smaller animals , like cats and mice , so it would avoid lighting up unnecessarily 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " i thought , why should each citizen pay for street lights that are n't being used 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 we now have a solution for that 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " spurred on by his professors , @entity25 entered the concept in a campus competition and won 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 @entity28 handed over their facilities and gave him the financial backing to create a demonstration on campus 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 since then , @entity69 has been implemented in four municipalities in @entity71 and one in @entity73 , with many more to come 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " we have enquiries from @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 the problem is not a lack of enquiries , it 's the team 's capacity to deliver the solution worldwide , " he says 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles

 @entity23 's primary purpose is to conserve energy 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 but when @entity0 invited @entity26 artist @entity101 to offer advice as a mentor for @entity25 , he pointed to the technology 's more artistic potential 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " how can we use the technology to make environments more human 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 more sustainable 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 more natural 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " asks @entity101 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " we want to make it like it 's your friend , or it 's an animal , or it does things you do n't know about 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 it 's not just a machine with a feedback loop , but something that has its own intelligence and is willing to negotiate , to hack you in the same way you hack it 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " so , for example , an ambulance or fire truck could communicate with the lamps to make them flicker red before they drive through 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles

 " it could save a life 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 " @entity101 suggests the uses could be " pragmatic or super poetic 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles

 it is the type of thinking that garners endless scenarios 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 depending on the occasion , streetlamps can flicker and change color to create any number of designs 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
 @entity25 envisions that during a live sporting event , a street could even spell out the score 	@placeholder is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
