@entity0 ( @entity1 ) many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of @entity4 and @entity5 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times , but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 consequently , @entity15 's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or , more accurately , to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 as @entity28 sociologist @entity27 pointed out , one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in @entity15 -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 less prominent victims of state - sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 however disappointed we may be in the actions of @entity15 president @entity56 -- in whom so many inside and outside @entity15 have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 first , @entity62 -- popularly known as @entity56 -- is @entity15 's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other @entity15 see as a problem 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 @entity15 's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 this is not a justification for his actions , but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in @entity15 , at least @entity56 can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 we may not like @entity15 's laws , but they are being applied even - handedly within national borders where state officials have authority 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of @entity15 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state - sanctioned violence 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 other countries -- including @entity0 -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 this propensity for the application of state - sanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected , but who has inevitably disappointed 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 after the unilateralism of @entity110 , @entity108 was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 paradoxically enough , though , while @entity108 has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more @entity124 forces to the @entity125 , this has done nothing to curb the use of state - sanctioned violence 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 on the contrary , the use of drone strikes has become a key part of @entity124 's continuing war on terror 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 it is unsurprising , perhaps , that a cerebral and reflective leader as @entity108 is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 unlike @entity56 , @entity108 does n't have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 or he does n't unless they 're @entity124 citizens , at least 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 the recent death of an @entity124 hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for " collateral damage " 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 are these cases comparable 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 yes and no	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 @entity56 's executions were cold - blooded , unnecessary and highly political 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 @entity108 clearly was not intending to kill @entity124 , and this has only become an issue because one of the hostages actually was 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 however , dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 the key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another , especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 do good intentions justify one death and not another 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 perhaps 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 would we encourage the state to kill a thousand innocents if it meant eliminating @entity173 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 almost certainly 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 would we authorize a drone strike to kill @entity177 leader @entity175 if we thought a couple of passers - by might die , too 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 perhaps 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 would we permit the state to execute people 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 not any longer in @entity0 , at least 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 but before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane we 've become , perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 what was done in the name of the @entity15 state was undoubtedly awful , futile and reprehensible 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
 whether our moral calculus is quite so self - evidently superior is not quite so clear 	two of " @entity197 " were killed despite @placeholder 's pleas for mercy
