( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 's 2014 has been something of a roller - coaster ride but the year could still end on a high in the colt 's final race of the @entity7 thoroughbred horse racing season at @entity8 the peaks of a @entity11 triumph and a six - race winning streak have been matched by the disappointing lows of narrowly missing out on the @entity15 and a three - and - a - half - month layoff to rest 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 yet victory in the @entity18 on saturday could be enough to consign those darker memories to the past and fire the three - year - old chestnut colt to the prestigious @entity23 accolade at january 's @entity24 -- an annual ceremony recognizing the year 's best thoroughbred horses 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " winning the award after all these setbacks would be even sweeter , " @entity1 's trainer @entity27 told @entity0 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " it would be a great accomplishment for @entity1 and the highlight of the year for him 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 to win the @entity24 would really be something special 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " coming out on top at the grade 1 meet at @entity37 's @entity8 will be no easy task , however , given that it will be his maiden race on turf 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 in the days leading up to the event , @entity27 and jockey @entity42 have been working the horse hard on grass in anticipation that he will feel as at home there as he has done for much of the season on dirt 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " i do n't think him running on grass for the first time will be a problem myself , i have a good feeling about this , " @entity27 says 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " if he gets the win then i think he deserves to be named @entity23 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 to win on grass would be a whole new dimension for him , with his running style , so the voters would have to appreciate that 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " an eventful year victory on grass would seal a fourth grade 1 triumph of the year -- two more than any of his rivals have managed in 2014 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 the three previous successes came at the @entity71 , the @entity11 and the @entity72 -- part of a six - race winning streak that captured the @entity7 public 's imagination and set up the possibility of a first @entity15 win in the sport since 1978 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " he got better and better as he turned three , he just got more mature , " says @entity27 , who became the oldest trainer to win the @entity11 in may at the age of 77 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " he really is something else , the @entity85 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 i 've had some great horses , but i 've never had one like him 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " the @entity11 and @entity72 triumphs , however , could not be replicated in june 's @entity89 -- the three - year - old had to settle for fourth -- and so the wait for a 12th horse to achieve the @entity15 goes on 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 @entity93 -- one of the horse 's two principal owners -- reacted to the loss with a barrage of unsporting criticism and was later humiliated in the media for what was perceived as a severe case of sour grapes 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 he later apologized 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 @entity27 , meanwhile , still struggles to talk about the @entity15 near miss , and @entity1 himself has yet to record a victory since the disappointment at @entity106 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " i thought we could win that @entity15 going into the last race , " @entity27 recalls 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " but @entity1 had problems in the race -- he was stuck and could n't get out , he was stuck down in the railing 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " you hate making excuses for the horse , except i think he could have been the winner , i really do 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 the @entity15 would really have been something 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 it would have been a real highlight 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " despite the setback , @entity27 remains confident that the chestnut colt 's record this year will be " enough " to at least secure the three - year - old - male title at the @entity24 , with a trophy being presented to the most impressive horse in each division 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 ifs and buts had @entity1 won the @entity128 in october the @entity23 award may have been a formality , but he could only finish third 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 the controversial race perhaps should have been more fruitful had @entity132 of @entity133 -- who finished first and second respectively -- been disqualified for early collisions involving the unfortunate @entity136 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " it was frustrating watching the way the start went , it was very controversial 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 we 're dealing with a $ 5 million race here , " says @entity27 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " if we 'd have won the @entity128 , the @entity24 would have been tied up by now 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 if there had been a double disqualification then we would have won 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " " but timing is everything in this game , " @entity27 adds on @entity1 's return from his rest period 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " i never got the chance to get a strong race out of him afterwards 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 i think that 's what cost us the @entity128 , to be honest with you 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " looking ahead while 2014 appears to be tinged with a sense of regret for @entity27 , it is still a year that has brought about unforeseeable levels of success , and the future remains bright for @entity1 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 despite persistent rumors that the three - year - old might not even race next year , it has since been confirmed that the chestnut colt will be back on the track in 2015 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " the success this year has n't come without its setbacks 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 but when you 're running horses you 're always going to have setbacks and you ca n't have a perfect trip , " @entity27 says 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " i was n't 100 % sure if he was going to race anymore 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 there were rumors that people were going to try to buy him , but the owners want to race him at four years old 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " he will be racing next season and the future is looking good , you bet 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " lost among the excitement of looking ahead to the future for @entity1 , while also reflecting on this year 's achievements , it can be easy to forget about the horse 's humble beginnings and just how the story all started 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 @entity93 and co-owner @entity190 splashed out a mere $ 10,000 in total , paying $ 8,000 for mare @entity193 in 2009 , before then later breeding her to stallion @entity194 for a reduced fee of $ 2,000 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 fast forward to today , and that investment has produced an offspring which has amassed $ 4 million in career earnings , is said to be worth in the region of $ 12 million and is potentially one race away from being crowned the supreme horse of 2014 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " winning the award would really be something , and what a great story for everyone to write about given the horse has gone from a $ 10,000 investment to making the money he has made , " @entity27 says 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 " it 's a poor man 's dream 	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
 "	trainer @entity27 hopes a win can clinch top @placeholder thoroughbred award
