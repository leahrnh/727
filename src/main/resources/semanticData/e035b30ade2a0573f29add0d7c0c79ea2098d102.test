@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- in my @entity5 quest i am visiting states firmly for president @entity7 ( @entity8 ) , those strongly for @entity10 ( @entity11 ) and some , like my next train stop , which ca n't make up their minds 	@entity2 's @entity178 is in @entity1 , a state that leans @entity18 but went for @placeholder in 2008
 @entity1 , is one of these " undecided " states , which have become crucially important 	@entity2 's @entity178 is in @entity1 , a state that leans @entity18 but went for @placeholder in 2008

 there is the rising number of @entity57 voters , who could be crucial if they cast their ballot 	@entity2 's @entity178 is in @entity1 , a state that leans @entity18 but went for @placeholder in 2008

 so today @entity1 is absolutely split 	@entity2 's @entity178 is in @entity1 , a state that leans @entity18 but went for @placeholder in 2008
