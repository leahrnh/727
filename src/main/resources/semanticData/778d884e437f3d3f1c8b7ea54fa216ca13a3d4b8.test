( @entity2 ) fifty years ago in @entity3 , @entity1 prosecutors tried 22 former @entity5 soldiers at @entity6 in what remains the most famous @entity9 trial staged in @entity1 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 at the time , @entity10 , the @entity1 - @entity11 attorney general of @entity12 , expressed the simple hope that " sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ' what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 ' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at @entity6 , and the air would be cleared 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 " sadly , @entity10 observed , " it has not been uttered , nor will it be 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 " the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of @entity9 trials 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 @entity31 , whose conviction by a @entity34 court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of @entity37 , remained defiantly silent during his 18 - month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 over the years , an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that @entity5 men had engaged in extermination out of duress 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 the results were astonishing : investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a @entity1 officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 not one 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 these evasions and lies were often effective , as many @entity1 trials of @entity9 perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 @entity10 can now exhale 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in @entity78 , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 @entity11 during his service at @entity6 , the 93 - year - old @entity37 faced the court and acknowledged , " it is beyond question that i am morally complicit 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 " if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 of course , in acknowledging his moral complicity , @entity95 fell short of confessing legal guilt 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 indeed , for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law , arguing , in an interview with @entity104 in 2005 , that he had been no more than a " cog in the gears 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 " at @entity6 , @entity37 was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to @entity114 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 in performing this task , @entity37 insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 but does this relieve him of criminal liability 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 for decades @entity1 courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under @entity1 law 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 in 2011 , the @entity31 conviction changed that 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 in convicting @entity31 as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 @entity11 at the @entity136 death camp , the @entity34 court concluded that death camp guards , regardless of how they had conducted themselves , had to be accessories to murder , because that was their job 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 it was a crucial breakthrough , because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 when it comes to factory - like genocide , guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness ; guilt follows function 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the @entity34 court 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 by this standard , @entity95 's truthful claim that he was no more than " a cog " constitutes an admission of guilt 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 this does not mean that @entity37 deserves the same measure of punishment as an @entity5 sadist 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 in fact , it 's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 but without the court 's conviction , @entity95 's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 the significance of @entity37 's trial can be measured in one final way 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity183 but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 april 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of @entity188 by the @entity189 during @entity190 , an event many have described as genocide 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 and yet the @entity193 nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
 with that in mind , @entity37 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning 	@placeholder is on trial over his alleged role in deaths at @entity6
