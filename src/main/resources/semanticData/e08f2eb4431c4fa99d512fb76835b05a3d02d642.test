 the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity2 : to someone who 's never read your books before , how would you describe your style 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity3 : i would describe [ my books ] as being , not quite allegories , but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in , and disguised by , the guise of children 's stories 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 in other words , i use children 's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 and it 's going to be fun 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 and indeed i hope it is fun 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 but once i get people involved in the plot , i hope to also communicate some of the questions i have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity2 : talk to me about @entity97 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 what 's his personality like 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 what is he going through 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity33 : well , @entity97 is the name that i 've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called " @entity52 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 " and i gave him that name for two reasons : one , because it does sound like a shiver , and he is always slightly spooked by the world ; and the second reason , because the two letters in it b - r - r - r are both letters from the name of @entity116 , who played the @entity55 so famously in the 1939 @entity118 film 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 his character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the @entity118 logo 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 the ideal lion , and the kind of sad , sacked , out of work , vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when @entity130 actually runs into the lion on the @entity132 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 in other words , there 's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we 're the most down in the dumps 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 there 's a huge space in between there 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 so the novel 's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity2 : everyone knows of your success with " @entity26 " -- it 's huge 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 but what was your life like before you wrote that book 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity33 : i had written children 's books for 14 years before i published " wicked 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 " and none of them were poorly reviewed , and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i was the traditional artist in the garret , expecting to live that way or maybe to give up writing soon because i would eventually have to get a job that was going to pay me some kind of retirement package 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 silly thought , that , these days 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity2 : you often take the point of view of the " wicked " or " evil " characters in your books 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 how do you get inside their heads 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity33 : well , i like to think i 'm a pretty good - natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 but i do seem to have an unconscionable , easy time of thinking about how people might do wrong , of what they might feel like and how they might behave if they had less self - control than i do 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 and then also , how they would have to deal with the weight of being called evil 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 if everyone was always calling you a bad name , how much of that would you internalize 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 how much of that would you say , all right , go ahead , i 'll be everything that you call me because i have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 by whose standards should i live 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 in a way , all three of my adult books come down to that question -- by whose standards should i live 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 can i find my own standards 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 can i recognize them 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 can i value them if i can name them 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 and are they good enough , are they strong enough , standards by which to live 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity2 : you talked about writing children 's books 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 how is writing for children different than writing for adults 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity33 : well , for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 so you have to start out active , you have to start out strong and you can not be , for a moment , self - indulgent 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 everything has to be a sound bite or something that the children can visualize as if they 're running a little @entity218 projector in their mind 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 now i date myself with ancient technology , but you know what i mean 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 write the scene that you want @entity225 to film , which means every sentence has to give us something to see 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 make it intensely visual and this is , i think , the main rule for writing for children 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 but in no way do i make it less thoughtful 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i just actually have to work harder 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 writing for children is like the difference between writing a sonnet and writing a gossip column 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i mean you have a lot more restrictions so you have to work a lot harder 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i 'm not saying that a gossip column ca n't be intensely rewarding , but i dare say it 's easier to write 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity2 : have you ever considered writing anything that 's not magical , or more real life 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 @entity33 : i have , but i never seem to get very far 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 in a way , and i do n't mean to talk myself down , but sometimes i look at the mysteries of other people and i think , " how do i know if they think anything like i think 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 " i can only guess who you might be 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 you might see the world in a whole different range of colors than i do 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 you might be super sensitive to nuances of body language or music or 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i just do n't know 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 so i always feel when i try to write realistic fiction for adults , that maybe i do n't have enough life experience , even though i 'm 54 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i 'm not sure i trust it 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 but when i write something that has a magic base to it , i put in everything i do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior , but nobody can call me out and say , " you do n't even know who human beings are " because i 've couched it 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 i suppose it 's a kind of safety net for myself , or a security blanket 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
 if i 'm writing magic , nobody can say i got it wrong because we all know magic does n't exist 	@entity3 's new book , " @entity52 , " is about the @placeholder
