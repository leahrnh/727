 i 'm @entity25 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 let 's get started 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 first up : @entity27 @entity28 : first up , president @entity29 announces a " new chapter " in the @entity32 policy toward the @entity33 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 in yesterday 's speech , the president talked about all of the upheaval that 's been sweeping across that part of the world 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 he called the revolutions and political protests a wave of change that can not be denied 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33

 and he spoke out harshly against governments that have used force on protesters 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 he also pushed to re-start the @entity53 - @entity52 peace process , saying that the demand for change in the region might help kick - start negotiations 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 in terms of changes across the entire @entity33 , the president said " it will be years before this story reaches its end 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 " but he explained why the @entity32 supports change 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity32 president @entity29 : there 's no straight line to progress , and hardship always accompanies a season of hope 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 the @entity32 was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33

 @entity79 @entity28 : the @entity80 is setting a record in the city of @entity4 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 but not the kind anyone wants to celebrate 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 the river crested -- reached its highest point -- at just over 57 feet 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 that 's more than a foot higher than the old record , set in 1927 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 what you should be seeing here is a runway 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 this is a small airport 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 these hangars are the only sign of that now 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity5 also suffered its first flood - related death yesterday 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 we 've reported on some of the people affected by the @entity5 's rising waters 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 there are also concerns about wildlife , like this coyote you saw a moment ago , who 's searching for higher ground 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 this day in history @entity28 : it 's may 20th , and on this day in history in 1902 , @entity110 gained its independence after being ruled by @entity113 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 in 1927 , @entity32 aviator @entity114 took off for his famous flight across the @entity116 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 it was the world 's first solo , non-stop , transatlantic flight 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33

 it was the first time that goal was accomplished by a female pilot 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity6 's economy @entity28 : next up , we have a report from @entity129 that 's related to @entity6 's gross domestic product , or gdp 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 that 's the total value of all the goods and services that a country produces in a given amount of time 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity6 's gdp is down 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 and to find out one of the big reasons why , you just need to look back at what happened a couple months ago 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 ( begin video ) @entity143 , @entity0 correspondent : the tsunami that leveled @entity6 's northern coastline on march 11th is now , two months later , destroying a new terrain : the country 's economy 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity6 's government announced the nation 's gross domestic product fell at a surprising 3	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
7 % annualized rate in the first quarter of 2011 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 it 's the second quarter in a row the gdp has fallen , meaning @entity6 is now in a recession 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 look deeper into the gdp fall , and the numbers are even more grim 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 industrial output , which includes all the consumer products @entity6 sends around the world , plunged 15	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
3 % in march , the worst ever recorded in @entity6 's history 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 the auto industry hurt the most 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 car production fell almost 60 percent in march 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity166 's president and ceo @entity165 re-opened a hard - hit factory in the tsunami zone just this week , leading workers in a rah - rah session , but acknowledging full recovery for the company is still months away 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 in the hard - hit region of @entity175 , half of the companies and factories -- 10,000 of them -- are affected by the earthquake and tsunami ; 600 expected to close 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity6 's government says a quarter of a million foreigners left @entity6 in the immediate aftermath of the disaster 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 as far as tourism coming in , it 's fallen off a cliff 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 airports are reporting a 35 to 60 percent drop in travelers 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 the nuclear crisis at @entity192 is also fueling concerns of an energy shortage , impacting @entity6 's ability to produce cars , electronics and parts for months to come 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 experts say @entity6 's economy was already struggling before the disaster 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity203 senior economist @entity202 believes there is a chance the disaster could have an unintended positive outcome 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity208 , @entity209 economist : the silver lining of this earthquake was that perhaps this will accelerate the reform pressures , and that @entity6 , then , in a year or two years from now , emerges stronger than it actually had been in the run - up to the earthquake 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 ( @entity216 ) @entity217 @entity218 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity221 's social studies classes at @entity222 in @entity223 , @entity224 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 what does an odometer measure 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 you know what to do 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 is it : a ) @entity232 , b ) distance , c ) rotation or @entity233 ) temperature 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 you 've got three seconds -- go 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 an odometer measures distance , like how far your car has traveled 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 tax on @entity242 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity28 : some lawmakers are looking into the idea of charging drivers based on their odometers 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 right now , part of what you pay to fill up your car is a federal gas tax 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 that money gets used to build and maintain highways and to help pay for mass transit systems 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 but with more fuel - efficient cars on the road , people are driving more miles using less gas 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 so this " driving tax " would charge people by the mile , either instead of or in addition to the gas they buy 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 the more you drive , the more you pay 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 it might help bring in money to the government , but some critics say collecting mileage information raises concerns about privacy 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 should the government know how much you drive 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 also , they 're worried that this could be unfair to drivers in more rural areas who have to drive farther 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity276 @entity28 : now , this is n't an official proposal ; it 's just an idea at this point that some people are talking about 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 we want you to talk about it 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 do you think it 's better to tax drivers by the mile or the gallon 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33

 around in circles @entity28 : all right , we 're going to stay in the driving lane here and look at something called a roundabout 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 it 's a kind of intersection , but not one with a traditional crossing 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 a roundabout -- as the name suggests -- is a circle 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 officials say they do n't make sense in every situation 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 but @entity307 steers us toward one mayor who 's all about the circular logic 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 ( begin video ) @entity312 , @entity0 correspondent : north of @entity313 , in the suburb of @entity7 , mayor @entity314 has been going around in circles for years over traffic jams 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity319 @entity318 , ( r ) @entity7 , @entity8 : roundabouts work everywhere @entity321 : he has done away with traffic lights at 80 % of his town 's major intersections , replacing them with roundabouts 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 whirlpools of traffic that keep people moving 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity331 : it 's made a huge difference in the way our city looks and feels , and the way people get around 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity321 : roundabouts , not to be confused with bigger , more intimidating rotaries on the @entity340 , are designed to smoothly sweep drivers in from any direction , slowly guide them around , and just as easily let them out and on their way 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 since cars do n't stop , commuters save time and , officials say , use 30 % less gas at intersections 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity331 : a roundabout can handle about 4 to 5 times the amount of traffic in the same amount of time as a stop light intersection can have 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity321 : the mayor says intersection accidents are also way down , improving insurance rates 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 and the city saves money , too 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity331 : we do n't have to buy a $ 150,000 signal 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 we do n't have to buy electricity every year 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 and we do n't have to replace it after 15 years when all that mechanical equipment wears out 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
 @entity321 : some drivers and pedestrians do n't like roundabouts , but local officials insist this simple idea is building up the quality of life here , and that 's building up the business climate all around 	president @placeholder outlines a " new chapter " in @entity32 policy toward the @entity33
