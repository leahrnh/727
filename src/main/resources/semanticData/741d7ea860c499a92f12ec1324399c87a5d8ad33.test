( @entity1 ) these are fearful times on the highest mountain in the world 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the devastating earthquake that hit @entity6 on saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead , missing , injured or trapped on @entity10 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 and aftershocks , including a strong one sunday , are continuing to send snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside , complicating rescue efforts 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " we were sitting here in base camp , feeling the situation was getting better , " said climber @entity16 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " and then suddenly , we felt the aftershock , " he told @entity1 on sunday 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " and immediately after the shock , we hear avalanches from all the mountains around us 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " but those avalanches did n't appear to be on the same scale as those that came roaring down on the camp saturday 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the base camp on the @entity6 side of @entity10 is in a vulnerable spot , sitting in a valley surrounded by high @entity35 peaks 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 when the huge , lengthy quake struck saturday , the scores of climbers who had gathered there to prepare for or recover from ascents of the peak had nowhere to run 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " an earthquake that long set off avalanches all the way around us 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 and they came down -- they were large , they were massive avalanches , " said @entity47 , an @entity48 mountaineer at the base camp 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 people tried to flee as the onrushing wall of snow , ice and rocks took out large sections of the camp 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " they were trying to outrun the avalanche and you can not , " said @entity16 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " so many people were hit from behind , blown off the mountain , blown into rocks , hit by debris , tents were flying off 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " he said he took shelter behind a large pile of stones 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " i could hardly breathe , but i could stay until the avalanche was over , " he told @entity1 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 a huge cloud of snow dust billowed hundreds of feet into the sky 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " we all ducked for cover until the cloud passed and then started dealing with the aftermath , " @entity47 said 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 that included at least 17 people killed , dozens injured and many others missing , he said 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 they are one part of the enormous human toll in @entity6 and beyond from the catastrophic quake 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the many unhurt people at the camp scrambled to help the injured , digging them out of the snow and turning dining tents into makeshift field hospitals 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 @entity92 that continued to fall made it hard for them to see , hampering their efforts 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 climbers worked in shifts through the night , nursing the injured as they waited for the weather conditions to improve to allow helicopters in 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " a lot of them are in pretty tough shape , " @entity47 said of the injured 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the airlifts of those with the most severe injuries began sunday morning after the weather cleared 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " the sun is breaking through the clouds , and the choppers are coming in , " @entity47 said 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " we 're pretty grateful 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 we 're going to get these guys down the hill 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " @entity16 said that most of the injured people at the base camp had been airlifted out by sunday afternoon 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 but concerns were growing for the groups of climbers stuck farther up the 29,035 - foot ( 8,848 - meter ) mountain in @entity119 and 2 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the avalanche was reported to have trapped them above the icefall area , an already treacherous part of the mountain that separates the base camp from @entity126 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 " they 'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall , " said @entity127 , the first @entity48 to reach the summit of @entity10 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 the climbers " will have to cool it for a couple days , wait until the route is re-established , " he told @entity1 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 but the frequent aftershocks were making that task more difficult 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
 @entity136 , a mountaineer at the base camp , said sunday on @entity138 that ropes and other gear were being helicoptered to the people trapped above the icefall 	helicopters begin airlifting injured people from the base camp in @placeholder
