( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 told reporters over the weekend that " deliberate " action by somebody on board accounted for @entity7 veering off course 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 could the mystery of @entity9 370 then be explained as an act of terrorism 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 to answer that you have to assess both the capabilities and the intentions of the known terrorist groups that might want to hijack such a plane 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 and you have to ask the question : cui bono 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 for whose benefit 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the @entity22 - affiliated group , @entity21 , has a presence in @entity2 as well as in the @entity24 and @entity25 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 but the group has been under sustained law enforcement pressure for more than a decade after it bombed nightclubs on the @entity25 island of @entity29 in 2002 , killing more than 200 people , mostly @entity31 tourists 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the group has also carried out bombings at the @entity33 in @entity25 and the @entity34 and @entity35 in the @entity25 capital , @entity37 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 however , the capabilities of the once - potent @entity21 have eroded over time 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 and would @entity21 , an @entity40 militant group , target for attack the air carrier of a majority @entity44 country on which quite a number of @entity44 were likely traveling 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 it is more plausible that the group would select a @entity31 airline because @entity31 embassies and @entity31 brand - name hotels have been the focus of their previous attacks and plots 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 a terrorist group that might have a motive is the @entity57 , a separatist group in @entity58 founded by @entity59 that has had some historical ties to @entity22 and the @entity61 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the @entity59 are an ethnic group in western @entity58 who are @entity44 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the group has conducted a number of terrorist attacks in @entity58 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 uyghur terrorists might have a motive to hijack the @entity9 flight as it was bound for @entity69 and most of the passengers were @entity58 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 but @entity59 militants have operated almost exclusively inside @entity58 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 and when they have tried to mount hijackings in the past they have been complete flops 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 on march 9 , 2008 , a 19 - year old @entity59 woman attempted to set off some kind of explosive device on a flight from the @entity80 en route to @entity69 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the flight crew detained the woman before she could detonate the device 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 four year later , on june 29 , 2012 , half a dozen @entity59 men attempted to take control of an aircraft flying in the @entity80 using pieces of a metal crutch that had been sharpened to make crude weapons 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 this plot was also foiled 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 bolstering the view that @entity59 terrorists did not hijack the @entity9 flight , on tuesday a @entity58 official said that background checks on the passengers on the plane produced no evidence that any of the @entity58 citizens on board were involved in terrorism 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 beyond @entity59 militants or operatives of @entity21 , might there be other terrorist groups with the motivation and capability of pulling off the hijacking of the @entity9 flight 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 it does n't seem so 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 if this were a hijacking for political purposes , the hijacking would have been followed by an act designed to send a political message , such as the planes hijacked on 9/11 that were then flown into the @entity117 and @entity118 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 or there would be set of demands , as was the case with the @entity123 flight that was hijacked to @entity124 , @entity125 , by militant @entity127 separatists in december 1999 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 they demanded the release of leading militants in @entity132 jails , a demand to which the @entity132 government acceded 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 or there would be a credible claim of responsibility 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 the one claim of responsibility so far is from an outfit calling itself the @entity142 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 this claim is not deemed to be credible 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 @entity2 transport minister datuk seri @entity144 told reporters last week : " there is no sound or credible grounds to justify their claims 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
 ' " if the diversion of @entity9 370 was not an act of terrorism , the other likely scenarios are a pilot suicide attempt , the piracy of the plane for some kind of economic reason or the commandeering of the aircraft by someone with an idiosyncratic motive that will only become clear over time 	@placeholder has a presence in @entity2 , but it has been on the decline , he says
