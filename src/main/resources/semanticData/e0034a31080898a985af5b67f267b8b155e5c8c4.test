( @entity0 ) -- for the past five years now , we here at the international women 's movement @entity2 have been waging an active campaign of resistance to the patriarchy in various corners of the world 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we have been bringing the world the simple idea of women 's liberation by means of sexual emancipation as expressed in highly visible acts of political protest 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we believe that the enslavement of women began with the enslavement of their sexuality , so we therefore consider it legitimate to use their liberated sexuality as a symbol of women 's worldwide liberation 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we divide the patriarchy confronting us into three basic parts 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 @entity29 , dictatorship , as a tool for enslaving women 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 for this reason we are a democratic movement 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 the second part of the system consists of religion and the church , which have overseen the spiritual enslavement of women 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 for this reason @entity2 is an atheistic group motivated by secularism and humanism 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy

 for this reason , then , @entity2 sees sexuality as the organon and canon of women 's freedom 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 hence , our three basic postulates are democracy , atheism , and sexuality 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 from what we have related above , naturally the most hated institutions are those that stand for one of these three things or a mixture of them 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 the most obvious illustration of the patriarchy is @entity71 theocracy , a symbiosis of political and religious dictatorship 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 in theocratic states , the position of women is horrifying and hopeless 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we direct our fiercest criticism to such countries , and work in that part of the world is what most occupies our minds 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 a clear example of the " @entity84 " under way in the @entity86 and @entity87 is what our activist @entity88 has gone through 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 for having published in @entity91 topless pictures of herself with " @entity93 " written on her body , @entity88 suffered severe criticism and death threats , and was kidnapped , beaten , and subjected to humiliating treatment 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy

 there , shut up inside a house , she underwent a forced " islamization : " they made her read the @entity109 and took her every day to see an imam 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 @entity88 's family also declared her insane and compelled her to ingest large doses of medication 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 " because i was taking so many pills , i was sleeping all the time , " @entity88 told me 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 " and once i woke up , i understood that i did n't remember anything 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 " @entity88 finally managed to escape 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 a few hours after @entity2 activists attacked the president of @entity121 shouting " where is @entity88 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 " i received a phone call : " @entity125 , this is @entity88 speaking 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 i 've escaped from my family 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 " after a long conversation about what she had gone through during her period of forced isolation , i asked her whether she thought it best for her safety to leave @entity121 for a while 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 @entity88 answered that she would not leave @entity121 until she had carried out a topless protest with other @entity121 girls who had already established contact with her 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 our understanding of @entity140 , according to what we have learned fighting against it , tells us that our criticism of it is valid and holds out much hope for the future 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 at the heart of @entity140 lies the enslavement of women based on control over their sexuality 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 the hijab is at the same time both a symbol and a tool of this enslavement 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 a mass sexual protest inspired by our example will serve as the first step toward women 's recovering their own nature and will be a turning point , sparking the dissolution of the @entity164 and the return , to women , of control over the conditions of her existence , from the sexual to the political 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 i hereby both promise and threaten to deploy an entire network of @entity2 activists in @entity175 countries 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we will hound @entity71 leaders across the globe , subjecting them to desolating criticism 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 we intend to hound spiritual leaders who are personally responsible for mistreating women 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 a million @entity181 will arise 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 and freedom , at last , will dawn 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 	@placeholder : @entity2 have been waging a campaign of resistance to the patriarchy
