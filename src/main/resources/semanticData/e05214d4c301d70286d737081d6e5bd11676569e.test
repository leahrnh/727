 @entity2 : i 've been with @entity6 about 25 years and known @entity1 pretty much through that entire period 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 @entity1 was a very kind person 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 he was a visionary 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 in the early days , @entity6 was doing very poorly as a company , and i got involved essentially to turn the company around 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 we had many , many conversations about the guitar business and what to do 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 a lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars

 it took years for @entity6 to actually come to terms with @entity1 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 he had been pitching the head of what was @entity6 's parent company , @entity54 , for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars

 and 300 units was not really that successful for @entity6 ; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 so @entity1 was always ahead of his time 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars

 what @entity1 did was turn it into a whole new instrument 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 when he was playing 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars

 and they 're very expensive today 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 [ @entity1 ] said , " you know , @entity2 , you really have to make a less expensive @entity1 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 " 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 we argued about it for a year and a half , and finally i gave in 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 i said , " ok , @entity1 , it 's your guitar 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 " 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
 and it was an instant success 	@entity6 ceo : @placeholder made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars
