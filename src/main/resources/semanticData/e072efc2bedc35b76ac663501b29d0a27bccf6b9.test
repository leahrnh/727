 @entity0 : " the @entity7 " is set in the early ' 90s , an era that a lot of people these days feel nostalgic about 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 what 's funny to you about this time period 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : i do n't really know what 's funny about it 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 everything is so tech now ; everyone is so connected that way 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it 's interesting in this movie that i have to tell @entity8 's character something , and i have to go to her house 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 which you would never do now 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 the whole movie would be done in two seconds now 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it was the last time when things were in that ' 50s vein 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 now , if i leave my cell phone at the house , i assume my house is on fire 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : you play a slacker pool manager , but you yourself are not a slacker 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 did you ever go through a stoner phase 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : no , i never did 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i actually do n't smoke pot that much 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i 've never been a big pot smoker 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 and when i do smoke pot , friends always say , " i feel like i 'm smoking pot with my dad 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " i was always the designated driver ; i never drank that much 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 not out of some moral thing 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it 's that i was n't that interested in that 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i was more of the drinking coffee at the coffee shop crowd 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 oddly enough , i was n't a very good student 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i did n't apply myself that well 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i was n't good at doing things i was n't interested in 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i used to think i was just slow , and a nice teacher said , " oh , you 're actually really smart , you do n't give a s * * * about anything 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " @entity0 : along with playing the lead , you 're also billed as a producer 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 are you looking to do more behind - the - scenes work in the future , like , say , @entity81 does 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : yeah 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i 'd love to direct a movie 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 that 's initially what i wanted to do 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 acting was never something on my radar 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i just did it as a fun extension of wanting to direct 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i thought i should act to know what actors go through 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i realized the acting thing really took 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 ( @entity93 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 ) @entity0 : last week , the @entity21 nominations came out , and it was the first time a male " @entity5 " cast member has been nominated twice for " @entity97 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " have you been in a " comedy sweet spot " the last few years , the way a basketball player might get hot shooting three pointers 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : i do n't know if it 's that or 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i do n't know 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i try not to think about it too much , or i 'll go crazy 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i used to always think that there was a shelf life on being funny 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 but i work with ( " @entity109 " creators ) @entity110 ( @entity111 ) and @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , and their show is in its 16th season , and every season is funnier 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 they figure out new things to do 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity121 , when he comes by ( " @entity5 " ) , he 's still the funniest human being on the planet 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity124 still makes me laugh 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 all these people i liked growing up are still making me laugh 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i try not to think about it too much in terms of myself 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : that 's probably good 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 you need to get some sleep 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : it 's not very healthy to think about yourself on those terms 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 you 'll go nuts 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 oddly enough , i have really bad stage fright -- getting up in front of people 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 and i made a living going on live television 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : would you be paranoid about the reactions after , or was it more of a " once it 's done , it 's done " 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : i 'd be done with it 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i 've done sketches on the show -- i do n't think i 've ever finished anything and thought , " oh , that was great 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " i 'm always like " uhhhh 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 why did n't i do this 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " it 's like a trap that i try to wiggle out of on - air 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 a mental trap 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i prepare stuff so compulsively 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i 'm constantly rereading 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i 'm constantly rereading the sketch , going over it 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 so i know it so well , and if the slightest thing does n't get a laugh , it used to throw me 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 toward my last couple seasons on the show , i 'd purposely do something i 've never done before 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 not so much say things but give a different look or pause differently 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 something that my brain would say " oh , you screwed up , " and suddenly i would relax 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 every saturday morning , i 'd wake up , and i 'd immediately start pacing 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i could not make my body stop moving 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i thought if i stopped moving , it would sink in that i have to go on live television tonight 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : it seems like leaving " @entity5 " might be good for your health 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : yeah , good for my mental health 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 no , i say all this , but in the moment , when it 's happening , it 's actually fun 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 especially if people are laughing 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : what was the conversation with @entity177 like 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 how does someone resign from this iconic show 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : i went into his office in february , and i think he knew that i was going to move to @entity22 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 that 's what it was really about 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 we got a family , and i want a backyard 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 that 's how it started 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it was really just excruciating small talk and then getting into the issue of the leaving 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 generally , @entity177 said , " i totally get it , you have a family 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i would love it if you stayed , but i get it 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " around may , i said i wanted to announce it , and that 's how it went 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it definitely was hard 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 people will say that they cried 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i thought i was going to pass out 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 when it was addressed and happened , it felt like a weight had been put on my shoulder or a weight had been lifted 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 all i know is that the room started tilting a bit 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it was a physical reaction to saying the words " i 'm leaving 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " it was crazy 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i did n't have a career 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i worked as an editor on " iron chef : @entity215 " before " snl 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " it 's the reason people know me 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : that 's quite a jump , from " iron chef : @entity215 " to " snl 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 " @entity1 : it was scary 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 for four years , i was waiting for them to figure out they made a giant mistake 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 i still ca n't really believe it 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity0 : @entity225 has certainly entered the hall of fame of " @entity5 " characters 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 was he your favorite 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity1 : he was one of my favorites 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 @entity231 , the reporter who was a real * * * * head , i loved playing him 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 what i liked about doing @entity225 is that you could play it kind of subtle 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
 it was right at the camera 	@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
