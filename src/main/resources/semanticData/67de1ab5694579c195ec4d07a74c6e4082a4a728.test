( @entity1 ) as we approach april 27 when @entity2 marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994 , we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against @entity8 migrants 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 outrage triggered by this violence is being heard loudly throughout social media with " @entity12 " showcasing the need for a common front against this affront 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 these recurring attacks against migrants and their property might be read as one more indication of how the rainbow nation 's dream has faltered 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 that vision not only symbolized a multi-ethnic @entity2 , but one where living in dignity is shared across racial and class lines 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 attacks against newcomers in @entity2 are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black @entity8 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 the national and international headlines use " xenophobia " as if any one word can convey the multifaceted crisis within which this phenomenon occurs 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 labeling this turmoil as xenophobic fails to convey the conditions in which @entity8 migrants are scapegoated for the persistent legacy of apartheid in the post-liberation era 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 this word also does not tell us that extreme poverty now exceeds that experienced under apartheid 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 and it certainly does not account for how extreme inequality is now fully embraced and normalized by a new black elite joining the " white - haves " of yesteryear 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 the question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam , as if the majority of black citizens and @entity8 migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white @entity2 or white foreigners 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 contact between the majority of african migrant groups and native black @entity2 mostly occurs in under - developed informal settlements and townships 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 in the interaction and competition between these groups in these spaces , we need to be wary of the simplistic treatment of @entity2 's ailment as xenophobia 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 such labeling does not and can not explain the totality of the contact , competition and conflict between native poor black @entity2 and foreign @entity8 entrepreneurs 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of @entity2 's black majority experiences segregation , persistent and relative poverty , and high crime rates in post-apartheid @entity2 is paramount 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 neglecting access to social rights , such as water , electricity , education and other services , is tantamount to violence by political leaders against the poor 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 condemning and prosecuting those who incite violence is essential to maintaining law and order and protecting those vulnerable because of their nationality 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 but the evictions , harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners can not and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor @entity2 in informal settlements and many townships experience 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 it can not and should not be separated from @entity2 's status as one of the most unequal societies in the world ; it can not and should not be separated from the fact that @entity2 has one of the highest homicide levels in the world 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 a mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society ( the poor , the disabled , women , children , the elderly ) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing @entity8 foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 labeling @entity2 's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other @entity8 bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 such labeling only serves politicians and the elites who are sealed off by barbed wire surrounded by a security industry that outspends and outnumbers @entity2 's police force 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 it allows corruption to persist while the political leaders who are implicated in this violence scapegoat " criminal youth " to further fill an overflowing prison industry 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 religious and civil society leaders ' recent mobilization saying " not in our name " in reaction to violence against migrants should be applauded 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 but religious , civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in @entity2 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 @entity171 misery and corruption in the midst of a nation with so much potential should not be tolerated 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 neither a hashtag of outrage @entity12 nor the expedience of the label " xenophobia " can wish away the angst , violence and the impending crisis in @entity2 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
 migrants ' security and dignity is part and parcel of a greater security and dignity for all @entity2 , which seem deferred for now 	killings of foreigners can not be separated from the brutal violence poor @placeholder experience , she adds .
