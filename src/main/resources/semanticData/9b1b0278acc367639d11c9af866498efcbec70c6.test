( @entity0 ) job one for newly appointed attorney general @entity1 is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of @entity6 , 25 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity6 's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in @entity12 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity1 's job wo n't be easy : as the nation 's top law enforcement officer , she takes the reins of a @entity17 that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations , and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 but as events in @entity12 demonstrate , too many local departments are n't getting the message 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity1 will need to put down the carrots , pick up the stick and make clear that the @entity17 intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons : the power to withhold federal funds from local departments 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 more about that in a moment 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 the first order of business will be to re-establish order in @entity12 , where the @entity45 has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " in the days ahead , i intend to work with leaders throughout @entity12 to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents , " @entity1 said within hours of being sworn in on monday 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " and i will bring the full resources of the @entity17 to bear in protecting those under threat , investigating wrongdoing and securing an end to violence 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " a key part of that vow -- " investigating wrongdoing " -- must include a close look at the @entity62 , which has been the subject of bitter complaints of brutality 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 according to a major investigation by the @entity68 published last fall , the city has paid out $ 5	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection with allegations of brutality and / or violations of civil rights 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " officers have battered dozens of residents who suffered broken bones -- jaws , noses , arms , legs , ankles -- head trauma , organ failure , and even death , coming during questionable arrests 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 some residents were beaten while handcuffed ; others were thrown to the pavement , " the @entity68 expose says 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " and in almost every case , prosecutors or judges dismissed the charges against the victims -- if charges were filed at all 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " that kind of behavior helped set the stage for the riots and looting we now see 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity1 has already launched a probe of the death of @entity6 , and the @entity17 is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 as attorney general , @entity1 has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 a justice department program called @entity119 , launched in 2011 , helps local departments implement best practices 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 the @entity119 program 's effectiveness will surely come under question , since @entity12 was one of the eight departments participating in the voluntary program 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity1 can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court - ordered reforms , a power conferred by the @entity132 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 the provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped police beating of @entity136 by @entity138 cops and the riot that ensued when the officers were acquitted 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 the @entity142 administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the @entity145 or @entity146 administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152 , @entity153 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 but even those tough remedies may not be working , according to the @entity155 , a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " even where local leaders have embraced @entity173 's prescriptions , @entity17 officials have increasingly found themselves returning to grapple a second time with problems they thought they had fixed , " writes reporter @entity157 , noting that " recurring problems have emerged in police departments in @entity151 , @entity160 and @entity161 , all of which had promised to carry out major changes in response to @entity17 investigations that turned up evidence of discriminatory policing 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 " that leaves @entity1 with a final , even tougher weapon : the power , under @entity179 of the @entity180 , to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 @entity1 's predecessor as attorney general , @entity184 , generally refrained from yanking funds , although in 2013 he did deny drug forfeiture money to the sheriff 's office in @entity190 , @entity191 , claiming the department was unlawfully targeting @entity193 for traffic stops 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 the sheriff of @entity190 sued the @entity17 and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that @entity1 has the power to press local departments , legally and financially , to curb local abuses 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
 she should invoke the power where necessary and calm cities like @entity12 as the nation heads into what could be a long , hot summer of unrest 	he says @placeholder case shows too many local departments not getting message
