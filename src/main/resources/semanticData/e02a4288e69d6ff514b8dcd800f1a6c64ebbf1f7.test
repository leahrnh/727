 in a press conference tuesday , @entity0 director @entity24 cautioned that this model is based on older data from august 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
 the numbers are not projections , but " scenarios 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
 " the model does not take into account president @entity33 's announcement that the @entity34 is sending troops and extra medical equipment to the area 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
 nor does it take into account the additional help from other countries promised 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
 what the model does suggests , he said , is that the current surge of help can " break the back of the epidemic " and is " exactly what 's needed " to end it 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
 he said he is now " confident the most dire predictions will not come to pass 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january

 the cumulative number of cases could exceed 20,000 by november 2 , the assessment said 	@placeholder : ebola cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to 550,000 by january
