 @entity0 said he understands and respects @entity9 's stance that @entity3 is particularly vulnerable and does n't " have the luxury of testing these propositions " in the deal 	@placeholder calls the nuclear deal with @entity5 a " once - in - a - lifetime opportunity "
 " but what i would say to them is that not only am i absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge , and that they can deter any potential future attacks , but what i 'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood , including @entity5 , a clarity that if @entity3 were to be attacked by any state , that we would stand by them , " @entity0 said 	@placeholder calls the nuclear deal with @entity5 a " once - in - a - lifetime opportunity "
