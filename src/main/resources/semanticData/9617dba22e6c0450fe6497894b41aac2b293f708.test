( @entity0 ) the best part of the @entity3 oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice @entity5 alluded to @entity6 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 ok , she did n't actually mention @entity6 , but @entity5 talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was " a dominant and a subordinate relationship 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " " yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , " said @entity5 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " it was her obligation to follow him 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " @entity19 , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same - sex couples who petitioned the @entity3 , said in response : " that 's correct 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 for centuries we had and @entity25 had this coverture system where a woman 's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " @entity42 , wives were the legal property of their husbands and " marital rape " was not only not a crime but not even a concept 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 to argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 justice @entity50 , widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines , at one point referred to " the nobility and the sacredness of marriage 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " which is true , if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 if anything , the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 one downside to arguing that marriage has " always been " between a man and a woman is that , therefore , any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples , too 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 the one justice who did n't ask a question is @entity83 , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 it should be carefully noted here that @entity83 is a black man married to a white woman 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in @entity92 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 that means that by 1967 , when the @entity3 considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the @entity99 " definition " of marriage for over 300 years 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 just 20 years after the @entity3 struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , @entity83 and his wife , @entity105 , were married 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 @entity106 , director of @entity107 at @entity108 , has written , " the fact that the @entity83 ' marriage required progressive @entity3 action must in some way inform their sense of this moment 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 " or maybe not 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 @entity83 did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the @entity3 doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 but perhaps the example of @entity83 speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of @entity99 , the @entity3 seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 perhaps this was always the case , justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 on the one hand , pulling pages right from @entity141 presidential candidates , conservative chief justice @entity138 suggested the court should n't intervene in a state - driven social debate 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 aping conservative religious activists , justice @entity145 asked whether four people could then get married 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 on the other hand , justice @entity148 talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while justice @entity152 pushed back on whether legalizing same - sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite - sex couples 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 both arguments , and the moral force beneath them , seemed to echo gay rights messaging 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 still , the highly political and momentous decision in @entity160 was unanimous 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 whichever way the court rules on same - sex marriage , it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the @entity3 will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up @entity99 in general , the @entity3 is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 the question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision — i think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
 the question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other 	@entity190 : @placeholder seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
