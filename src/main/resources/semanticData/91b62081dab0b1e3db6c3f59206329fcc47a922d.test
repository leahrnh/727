 full physical screening of employees also " is incapable of determining a person 's motivations , attitudes and capabilities to cause harm , among other limitations 	a new @placeholder report advises against full screening of airport workers

 " specifically , the @entity1 report said employee vetting should be strengthened by " updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses , instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional @entity97 ( @entity97 ) and @entity98 data sources , and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause 	a new @placeholder report advises against full screening of airport workers
