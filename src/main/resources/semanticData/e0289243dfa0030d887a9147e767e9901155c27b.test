( @entity0 ) -- eight women and four men convened regularly over 13 months 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 they heard from dozens of witnesses , considered 30,000 pieces of evidence 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 all of it was with one question in mind : who was responsible for 6 - year - old @entity11 's death 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 on october 13 , 1999 -- nearly three years after the diminutive @entity15 pageant queen 's body was found in her home -- the 12 grand jurors went back to their own homes , sworn to silence and with nothing apparently to show for their effort 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges , " then - @entity23 district attorney @entity22 said 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 the presumption was that the grand jury had n't voted to indict anyone 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 that included failing to take action against @entity11 's parents , @entity33 and @entity34 , whom @entity23 police had said were under " an umbrella of suspicion " in the girl 's death 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 yet the @entity39 , the daily newspaper in that @entity15 city , now says there was more to the story 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 citing several unidentified jurors as well as an assistant district attorney in @entity22 's office , the paper reports that the grand jury did , in fact , vote to indict the @entity50 parents on charges of child abuse resulting in death 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 @entity22 , the man who presented the case to them , did n't sign the indictment , however , the @entity39 reports 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 it 's a decision that @entity58 , a former prosecutor who was n't directly involved in the grand jury proceedings , confirmed to the paper and said makes sense 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " the state of the evidence in that case was simply inadequate to file a charge , in my opinion , and that obviously was @entity22 's opinion , too , " @entity58 said 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " whether it 's against one or two people , you just did n't have the evidence 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " those now in the @entity23 district attorney 's office are n't commenting on the report , spokeswoman @entity71 said monday 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 but @entity75 , the @entity76 lawyer for @entity50 , said , " i have known for years that @entity23 prosecutors did not file charges against @entity33 and @entity34 because the evidence to prosecute them did not exist 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " he said monday that any reported " confusion of the grand jury over child abuse " could have been addressed had the @entity50 parents testified , as they repeatedly offered to do 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 @entity75 also pointed to the 2008 findings from then - district attorney @entity84 that dna tests ruled out any @entity50 family member 's involvement in the girl 's death 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " the dna tests performed after the time of the @entity23 grand jury not only prove the @entity50 family to be innocent and the grand jury wrong , they also make former district attorney @entity22 a hero who wisely avoided a gross miscarriage of justice , " @entity75 told @entity0 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 @entity98 : ' there 's a killer on the loose ' it was december 26 , 1996 -- a day after @entity11 got a bicycle as a @entity104 gift -- when @entity34 said she discovered a three - page ransom note in her @entity23 home 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 police came and , later that day , found @entity11 's beaten and strangled body in the family 's basement 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 days after burying the girl in suburban @entity76 , where they had previously lived , the @entity111 appeared on @entity0 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " there 's a killer on the loose , " @entity34 said january 1 , 1997 , in an interview that brought an intense national spotlight on the case 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " i do n't know who it is 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 i do n't know if it 's a she or a he , but if i were a resident of @entity23 , i would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 there 's someone out there 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " the parents insisted an intruder committed the crime , but no one was caught and no description was given 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 in time , the focus turned on the parents : could they have done it 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 investigators did n't find footprints in the snow outside the home , there was no sign of forced entry 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 a paintbrush from her mother 's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked @entity11 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 and the alleged ransom note was written from paper inside the house and referenced little - known details about the family 's past and its finances 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 despite the suspicions , the @entity111 were never named as suspects 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 but they were a focus of the grand jury , which first convened in september 1998 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 on monday , @entity0 talked with one juror and another 's spouse , both of whom indicated that -- at the behest of the district attorney 's office -- they would not discuss the case 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 messages left by @entity0 with several other jurors were not immediately answered 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 but according to @entity58 and several jurors who talked with the @entity39 , the decision was eventually made to indict @entity33 and @entity34 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 this was even though the jurors were n't sure who , exactly , had killed young @entity11 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " we did n't know who did what , " a juror told the newspaper , according to a story on its website 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " but we felt the adults in the house may have done something that they certainly could have prevented ( @entity11 's death ) or they could have helped her 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 and they did n't 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " 16 years later , still no arrests or charges according to @entity58 , who worked as a prosecutor for 28 years before retiring , there was disagreement among the eight or so involved in the prosecution about what to do after the grand jury voted to indict 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 he told the @entity39 that he thinks his former boss did the right thing not pressing forward with the case , arguing that the evidence did n't show whether @entity34 or @entity50 may have been more directly responsible 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " if i were on a jury , i would not convict either of them , " said @entity58 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 as is , while there have been many twists and turns since the grand jury was discharged in 1999 , there 's been no closure 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 the @entity111 were busy in march 2000 , releasing their book " the death of @entity210 , " filing multimillion - dollar lawsuits against media organizations who they say libeled their son ( who was 9 at the time of @entity11 's death ) and settling a lawsuit with a tabloid newspaper 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 that may , the @entity111 returned to @entity0 to face off with @entity221 , a former @entity23 police detective who 'd released a book of his own 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 @entity221 claimed the girl died after " an explosive encounter " over a bed - wetting incident , something the @entity111 fiercely denied 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 the district attorney 's office , then led by @entity84 , took over the case from @entity23 police in 2002 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 four years later , there was an apparent breakthrough with the arrest of 41 - year - old teacher @entity11 in @entity234 , @entity235 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 this came after he freely -- and repeatedly -- said he was with @entity11 the night she died , although he insisted her death was an accident and that he " loved " her 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 but soon after his arrest and return to @entity15 , prosecutors announced dna evidence proved @entity11 had nothing to do with @entity11 's death 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 that same year , 2006 , @entity34 died at the age of 49 following a fight with ovarian cancer 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 then came @entity84 's 2008 letter to @entity50 , exonerating him and the rest of his family after tests of dna evidence found in the girl 's underwear and beneath her fingernails 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 " to the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime , i am deeply sorry , " @entity84 wrote 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 since then , authorities have said they 'd continued to try to find answers 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
 but despite their work , the case remains as cold as it was on that late december day , some 16 years ago 	a @placeholder paper reports a grand jury voted to indict @entity11 's parents
