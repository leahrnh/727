( @entity0 ) -- if there is one man who knows how to spoil a @entity5 party then it 's @entity6 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 while the majority of the 15,000 crowd packed inside @entity13 roared their home favorite @entity15 at every opportunity , their hopes of a @entity10 champion were extinguished once again 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 this was a pulsating clash between two men straining every ounce of energy from their tired bodies and stretching every sinew 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity6 , so dominant for so long after taking the opening two sets 6 - 4 6 - 1 , appeared set to return to his hotel early enough for a night out on the @entity25 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 but @entity15 , as infuriating as he is talented , did what he does best -- he entertained 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the @entity30 , playing to the crowd , took the next two sets 6 - 4 6 - 1 before imploding when the tie looked his for the taking 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 not since @entity34 was crowned champion in 1983 has @entity30 witnessed one of its own triumph on the clay 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 alas , the wait will now extend into a 32nd year 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity6 , who seemed to thrive on the partisan nature of the contest , eased to a 6 - 4 6 - 1 lead and seemingly had the match all wrapped up 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 in 2012 , @entity6 defeated @entity30 @entity44 in a similar setting , and that experience appeared to allow him to settle rather quickly 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the @entity47 , who was so impressive during his victory over @entity51 's @entity50 , looks to be far more comfortable with his game following a troublesome back injury 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 against @entity15 , a player he often practiced with and competed against as a child , he showed a maturity which the @entity30 sometimes lacks 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 nobody can doubt @entity15 ' ability to entertain but with that comes a constant frustration to combine his style with substance 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 after conceding the first set , @entity15 lost the plot completely in the second before rallying to ensure he at least won a game 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the third was more competitive with the home crowd urging the @entity68 to respond and take the contest into a fourth set 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 and their hero finally responded , converting the third of three set points to take the third 6 - 4 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 with the momentum firmly behind him , @entity15 broke to take a 4 - 1 lead in the fourth 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 suddenly , playing with the joie de vivre which had been missing earlier in the contest , @entity15 appeared unstoppable 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 he claimed the fourth set 6 - 1 and appeared set to apply the @entity80 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 but just as the home crowd was about to celebrate a famous victory , @entity6 wrecked any thoughts of popping @entity85 corks 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 he swept @entity15 away with disdain -- 6 - 0 to secure the match , finish the contest and throw down the gauntlet to his next opponent -- champion @entity91 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity91 can anybody stop @entity91 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 that 's the question @entity6 will have to answer 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity94 , the man vanquished in last year 's final by the eight - time @entity10 champion , was the latest man to feel the wrath of the " @entity91 " 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 after a slow start in which he conceded the first set 6 - 4 , @entity91 hit back to take the next three sets 6 - 4 6 - 0 6 - 1 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the @entity102 , who was beaten at @entity104 in april by @entity94 , remains a huge favorite to win the title 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity107 progresses @entity107 nearly quit tennis a year ago -- now she stands on the verge of reaching a first grand slam final 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the @entity111 , who lost in qualifying at @entity10 12 months ago , made the last eight at three of the four grand slams in 2011 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 but her career threatened to derail when she suffered back , knee and ankle injuries and spiraled down the rankings to 177 -- before returning to the tour in march 2013 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 the 26 - year - old , ranked 27 , proved too good for @entity123 's @entity122 as she carved out a 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 " today i was in a real zone , " she told reporters 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals

 it 's a very special moment , i have n't been there before 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 " @entity107 , who is the first @entity111 lady to reach the semifinals since @entity134 in 1999 , now faces a showdown with @entity137 's @entity136 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity136 , the highest seed left in the draw , overcame 2009 champion @entity140 of @entity141 6 - 2 6 - 2 to claim a place the semifinal of a grand slam for the first time 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
 @entity136 , ranked fourth in the world , won the junior event on the clay in 2008 and is now hoping to do the double by winning the @entity10 proper 	@placeholder to face @entity6 in semifinals
