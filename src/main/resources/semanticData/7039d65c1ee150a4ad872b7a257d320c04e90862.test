( @entity1 ) this weekend , millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 why is this 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 we 'll explore , but first let 's get something out of the way : the big fight between @entity10 and @entity11 wo n't " save " boxing , a sport that has fallen precipitously since its 20th century heyday 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 if anything , the so - called " @entity21 " just reinforces the sport 's problems , as two aging heroes collide in what might be the last nationally relevant fight for a very long time 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 there 's so much wrong with boxing 's business model , but all you really need to understand is this : most sports fans probably ca n't name a single active boxer after @entity11 and @entity10 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 some might know that the long - reigning heavyweight champ is a towering @entity30 with a boring jab - happy style , but most would n't come up with his name ( @entity34 ) 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 boxing is n't fading away because we 've finally awoken to its brutality but from a combination of catastrophic mismanagement and competition from @entity41 -- a younger , more dynamic and better - managed competitor 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 the rocket rise of @entity41 's premier organization , the @entity44 , has matched boxing 's equally dramatic decline 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 in the course of just two decades , the @entity44 has grown from a freaky - violent carny sideshow into a mainstream sport 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 in fact , the fan base of the @entity44 now rivals that of the world 's most popular fighting sport : ice hockey 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 some aficionados spin elaborate defenses of the hundreds of fist fights that break out every year in @entity60 games , claiming they make the game safer by punishing dirty play 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 but that 's so weak 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 everyone knows why the @entity60 has n't cracked down on fighting hard enough to end it : fans love it way too much 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 as the hockey announcer @entity74 once said , " when [ legendary tough guy ] @entity69 was fighting , did you ever see anyone get out of their seat and go get coffee 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 " but why do we like to watch fights in the first place 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 over the past 20 years , i 've watched boxing and mma in a spirit of nervous fascination 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 watching fighters kick , punch and strangle each other , i 'd be thinking , i 'm a civilized person 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 i appear not to be a sociopath 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 so why am i watching 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 what 's wrong with me 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 and what 's wrong with all of us 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 who among us has n't felt the giddy , guilty thrill of a fistfight breaking out -- whether in a schoolyard , a hockey rink or a prize ring 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 we all claim to hate violence , but i think we protest too much 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 inside us all , there 's a creature that adores it 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 how else are we to explain our yen for carnage in rough sports , films , gory video games and literature 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 so is that it 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 are we drawn to a big fight like @entity107 simply by bloodlust and barbarism 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 actually , i think that 's only part of the story , and not the biggest part 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 if we just wanted blood and pain , we would n't bother with the tame violence of pay - per - view fisticuffs 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 instead , we 'd fire up a web browser and watch @entity120 snuff videos for free 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 but many people who feel no temptation to watch internet snuff feel sorely tempted to watch a big fight 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 what 's going on 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 there 's a great literature on boxing , with contributions from writers such as @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 for them , boxing is n't really a sport 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 you ca n't play boxing like you can play tennis 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 they compared boxing to a rite , or a religion , or above all to theater , complete with spotlit performers improvising on an elevated stage 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 a fight was drama sweated down to the bones -- a metaphor for the whole human condition , with everything noble and ugly on display 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 while it may seem like a stretch , i think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what 's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what 's good and noble 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 prizefights set up conditions of dramatic adversity that evoke what we admire most in human beings : extremes of courage , grace , fortitude and even heroism 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 so should we feel virtuous as we watch @entity11 and @entity10 's epic brain damage contest 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 i would n't go that far 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 perhaps such spectacles really should , as most of the world 's medical societies insist , be abolished 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 most of us feel ambivalent toward prizefighting because we should 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 a fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display : the bared fangs , the blood , the frenetic drive to do harm 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 but all that dark stuff draws out the best stuff , and turns a great fight into a showcase for the indomitability of human will 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
 when @entity11 and @entity10 clash at center ring on saturday night , the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in 	@entity194 : millions to tune in to see @placeholder - @entity10 fight , but this does n't show resurgence of declining sport of boxing
