 most are extremely isolated from current events 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 few own televisions and even fewer have internet access 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 because of that , she expects most of her clients to stay with the clinic 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 however , she worries about its future and the potential for dwindling donations 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 most nonprofit donors assume low - income populations will register for @entity41 , so donations are n't necessary 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 however , many may not qualify for @entity20 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage

 those who make too much to qualify for support and too little to afford care are left in a coverage gray area 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 according to @entity49 , this group is now flocking to free clinics 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 it 's a trend seen elsewhere as well 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
 " regardless of a @entity9 expansion 	many make too much to qualify for @placeholder and not enough to get coverage
