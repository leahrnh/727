( @entity0 ) -- after the year he 's had , no one could blame @entity2 if he really does want to retire 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the 19 - year - old has spent the past 12 months stuck in a public storm of negative press , bad decisions , ailments and misfires , all while trying to scrub off the sheen of his tween popularity 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 with a barely there ' stache lingering on his upper lip , the pop star has spent 2013 attempting to assert his manhood and find a bridge over to the adult side of the pop world -- all without completely disregarding the persona or the young fans that helped him become a star in the first place 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 it 's a delicate and practically impossible balance , a tightrope that @entity2 , his ex-girlfriend @entity25 , and some cohorts like @entity27 and @entity28 have all walked this year to varying degrees of success 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 @entity31 , now 21 , has long shed the role that made her famous with younger crowds , that of @entity35 on the @entity37 's " @entity36 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " even as she grew more recognizable thanks to @entity37 's marketing prowess , @entity31 was never solely definable by the series -- there were departures for albums with her band , @entity45 , and movies like 2011 's " @entity48 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " but even with those efforts , @entity31 began 2013 with a still - intact image as a young adult star 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 although she 's in the same age group as her bff @entity55 , @entity31 did n't enjoy the same broad demographic appeal 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 then march brought @entity58 's " @entity57 , " a sly project aimed directly at the nexus of emerging womanhood 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 alongside one actress who 's already come out on the other side of the teen star transition , @entity67 , and one who stands on the cusp , @entity62 of " @entity63 , " @entity31 put on a string bikini and struck the requisite provocative poses 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 it was the kind of risque territory that legions of adolescent stars before her have eagerly walked into , because it always sends a crystal clear message : i 'm not a kid anymore , and it 's time you started treating me like an adult artist 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " the transition 's weird and it 's awkward , " @entity31 told @entity0 of trying to mature in the spotlight with projects like " @entity57 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " " you do n't really know what the right and wrong thing to do is when you do it , but you can just do projects that you 're really passionate about and this was something that i was definitely excited to be a part of 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " go back roughly 10 years and you would have heard something similar from a then 21 - year - old @entity95 , who caused her own uproar when she kissed @entity98 at the @entity99 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " honestly , it 's about me just performing and expressing myself , " she told @entity0 of the backlash to her " adult " behavior , which at the time left some , including this network , questioning how the change in the @entity107 's image would affect her young fans 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 although @entity111 herself perhaps put it best when she said , " i 'm not a girl ; not yet a woman , " she was n't the only one struggling 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 around the same time , @entity116 was " @entity127 " up her reputation with chaps and explicit lyrics , and @entity111 ' ex-boyfriend , @entity120 , was in the midst of reforming himself from a boy band member to bonafide pop star by promising to have his love interest " naked by the end of this song 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " he took his freshly cultivated sex appeal a step too far at the @entity131 halftime show , when he assisted in @entity133 's " wardrobe malfunction 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " but if there 's any comfort to be had for today 's young celebrities , it 's that each of those singers has been able to move past that " weird and awkward " phase @entity31 described 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 @entity2 especially is probably relieved to see that @entity120 survived that enormous scandal to dominate the charts years later with " the 20/20 experience 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " in @entity2 's case , he can end the year satisfied that he has stretched himself enough artistically to gain positive attention for an older sound , even if the world is n't quite ready to accept the adult artist he 's becoming 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 @entity2 never had to contend with being a part of what 's referred to as the " @entity37 machine , " but he did become very famous very quickly at a very young age 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 chances are it 's still difficult for the average adult older than 21 to name a @entity2 hit that is n't " baby " or " @entity158 , " two songs that helped launch his career when he was 15 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 so when he says he plans to retire -- which he 's done repeatedly in the weeks leading up to the end of the year in what may or may not be an extended prank that his rep wo n't comment on -- perhaps it 's more likely that he does n't want to quit singing but just wants to retire that old , floppy - haired image 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 in some ways he 's done that , even if it was inadvertently , with the constant topless photos he 's shared , his altercations with paparazzi , and the salacious rumors that dogged the @entity175 stretch of his tour this year 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the music he 's created -- sultry songs about love , heartbreak and pillow talk , with a suggestive video to match -- have only further shown his willingness to leave the kids ' table 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 one of his tour companions , @entity28 , has shown the same desire in a much more subtle way 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 at 20 , @entity189 is best known to the under - 18s as @entity192 's @entity191 on the network 's " victorious " and " @entity195 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " but with the release of her debut album , " yours truly , " in august , @entity189 proved she 's ready and capable to handle an older audience 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 she did that not with the usual scandals but with a no	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 1 album that gained her entr√©e to larger platforms , such as a performance at the @entity207 that earned praise from the likes of @entity210 and @entity211 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the @entity37 says it 's aware of the rocky terrain that lies ahead for kids who want a career beyond the network 's family - friendly realm 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 according to @entity217 , the senior vice president of @entity37 @entity218 , the @entity37 does n't try to " control or dictate an actor 's image " while they 're working with the company , although they do offer a " @entity222 " orientation to help the budding star prepare for what 's ahead 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 outside that guidance , though , @entity217 said in a statement that " the talent has the control over their career ; we want them to be obligated to the art of their craft not obligated to us 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 we recognize we are working with young people at a transition in their personal development -- aka , teenagers -- and we trust parents of employed minors to support and guide their kids 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " and , when the time comes that said talent wants to move on from @entity37 , " we do n't try to slow the hands of time , " she continued 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " hopefully , these young actors continue to follow their dreams , explore roles that make sense for them and take their career to the next level 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 " for at least one former @entity37 name , @entity27 , making that leap to a new level meant burning down that @entity263 image altogether 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the 21 - year - old has been trying to liberate herself from her " @entity266 " past for years , but it was n't until 2013 when she was fully able to , in her own words , kill off the character who made her famous 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 with a new aesthetic , a discovered fondness for suggestive photography , an unfiltered @entity274 account and a bold approach to stealing the limelight at each and every awards show that had her on the bill , @entity27 cheerfully let her prior kid - friendly image go up in flames 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 although the public stood by and watched like a collective set of exasperated parents , @entity27 is entering 2014 with her mission accomplished 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the shock value of seeing a singer and actress who was once the idol of nearly every 9 - year - old in @entity293 swing naked from a wrecking ball has sunk in ; there 's little , if anything else , she needs to do to assert her adult independence 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
 the transition , for @entity27 at least , is complete 	@placeholder did a risque movie , @entity27 did risque everything
