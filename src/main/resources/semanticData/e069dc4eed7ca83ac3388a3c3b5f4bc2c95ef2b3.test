stop worrying about the website and start talking about @entity2 's benefits 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 that was president @entity5 's message to the nation on tuesday as he kicked off a three - week public relations blitz intended to generate more participation in his signature health care reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 a day after officials declared the previously dysfunctional @entity12 website working smoothly for most users , @entity5 held a @entity15 event to try to shift the focus of a fiercely partisan public debate to how much help the @entity19 offers @entity20 in need 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 he noted the botched website launch of october 1 set back implementation of the reforms , and encouraged supporters to help him reintroduce the law to a still skeptical nation 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " our poor execution in the first couple months on the website clouded the fact that there are a whole bunch of people who stand to benefit , " @entity5 said 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " now that the website 's working for the vast majority of people , we need to make sure that folks refocus on what 's at stake here 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " the administration hopes the new ability of @entity12 to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up for health coverage now required by law under the reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 however , officials including @entity5 , warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 in another potential problem disclosed tuesday , a @entity57 inspector general audit cited possible security weaknesses against potential fraud by people getting government subsidies under @entity2 to lower their health insurance costs 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 the @entity64 , which will enforce compliance with the law 's mandate to obtain health coverage , responded that it continues to develop systems to detect and prevent fraud involving subsidies when recipients file their 2014 tax returns 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 meanwhile , insurance companies say some " back - end " aspects of the @entity12 system continued to malfunction 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 in particular , insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website , including erroneous or missing information 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 @entity15 spokesman @entity84 said tech experts were working on the processing problems , offering assurances they would be fixed in time for enrollment starting on january 1 , 2014 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " we 're confident that they 'll be able to achieve that , " @entity84 said 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 critics , led by conservative republicans trying to dismantle the health care reforms known as @entity2 , say the website problems foreshadow deeper failings of the law that passed with no @entity93 support 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " it 's not just a broken website ; this bill is fundamentally flawed , " house speaker @entity102 said tuesday , later adding that " when you look at @entity2 , what you see is a government - centered health care delivery system 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " @entity20 do n't want that , the @entity114 @entity93 insisted , declaring they instead " want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance , they want to be able to pick their own doctor and they want to be able to pick their own hospital 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " @entity5 challenged @entity102 and other @entity93 to come up with something better instead of simply opposing and trying to obstruct the implementation of @entity2 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " we may never satisfy the law 's opponents , " he told an audience of supporters at the @entity15 , including embattled health secretary @entity122 , whose department oversees the reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 the president listed specific benefits , such as an end to lifetime caps on coverage and denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 because of @entity2 , parents can keep their children on family policies up to age 26 , and people can get free mammograms and other screening 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 now , he said , the 1 million visitors to @entity12 on monday showed the robust public interest in new health insurance exchanges under the reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " some have already convinced themselves that the law has failed , regardless of the evidence , " @entity5 said , prompting applause when he rejected @entity93 efforts to delay or dismantle the reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " we 're not repealing it as long as i 'm president , " he said , adding " we 're not going to walk away from it 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 if i 've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works , then that 's what i 'll do 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 " in a blog post on tuesday , the @entity158 announced that more than 1	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
46 million people have been added to @entity161 and @entity162 rolls due to expanded services under the health care reforms 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 the @entity2 offered states additional federal funding to offer @entity161 and @entity162 coverage to more low - income @entity20 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 so far , 24 states and the @entity170 have accepted the expansion funding while three others are still deciding and 23 have declined 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 more events will occur daily through december 23 , the deadline for people to get coverage that will take effect on january 1 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 a new - found confidence over the weekend , officials announced they had met their self - imposed november 30 deadline for getting the site working for the " vast majority " of users , saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 @entity187 , a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch , compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on - ramp from two lanes to four 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 that means chronic breakdowns , error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared , he said , noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system 's " uptime " -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90 % 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 it all means that @entity12 can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day , according to @entity187 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 a new component that put users in a waiting queue during periods of high volume provided a better - managed delay than the site freezes and error messages of october 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 the waiting queue also asked users if they wanted to receive an e-mail notifiying them when they could try again at the front of the line 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 according to an @entity158 official , 13,000 people requested an e-mail and 60 % of them -- roughly 7,800 -- later returned after getting the email notification 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 administration : @entity2 website working smoothly not all roses in the @entity230 vocal throughout the launch of the program and the successive problems , the @entity93 stayed vigilant with its critique 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19

 " the @entity5 administration had over three years to build @entity12 , and all they 've produced is a non-functioning website , wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19

 less than 27,000 of them did so through the @entity12 website , which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
 an administration official familiar with the matter told @entity255 that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month on the site 	@placeholder continue relentless attacks on the @entity19
