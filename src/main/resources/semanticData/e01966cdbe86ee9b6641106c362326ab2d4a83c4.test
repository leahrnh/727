@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a key whistle - blower in the intensifying scandal over wait times at veterans hospitals took issue on sunday with an initial internal review that downplayed the number of people who may have died while waiting for care 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 the comments came as the embattled @entity15 secretary received tepid support from some critics of the department 's handling of a chronic problem across many of the @entity23 's care facilities 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity23 secretary @entity24 has been at the center of political debate over accountability since @entity1 began reporting on delays in medical appointments suffered by veterans across the country , including some who died or were seriously injured 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 the @entity23 requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner , typically within 14 to 30 days 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity1 first reported as many as 40 veterans died waiting for appointments at the @entity40 health care system , according to sources inside the hospital and a doctor who worked there 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 many of those veterans were placed on a secret waiting list , the sources said 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 the department 's acting inspector general told a @entity51 panel thursday , " the number 40 that 's been widely quoted in the press does not represent the total numbers of veterans that we 're looking at 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " " the initial list that we were given , we have gone through and there are only 17 names on that list , " said @entity57 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " our review to date -- and we have more work to do on this because we want to have more than one set of eyes look at all of the records -- but on those 17 , we did n't conclude , so far , that the delay caused the death 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 it 's one thing to be on a waiting list , and it 's another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list , that 's the cause of death 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " it 's unclear if any of those 17 names were among the deaths reported by @entity1 , and @entity57 acknowledged that " multiple lists " exist 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " but there are also other people who have come through the @entity82 , who have come through the media , who have come through our hot line , so we have multiple lists , none of them identical , " @entity57 testified thursday 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 dr	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity89 , who made his allegations first to @entity1 , disputed @entity57 's testimony about the department 's initial conclusions 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " the original allegation was 40 people died while waiting for care 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 and they were advertising waiting times of 30 to 55 days when in fact they were more like six to seven months 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 and we had no way of reviewing these charts , " said @entity89 on " @entity99 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " " so , we never said they died because of this 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 we just made the point that at least 40 veterans we felt had died while waiting 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " @entity89 has said the larger problem was the @entity23 lied about it and fudged the numbers 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " they 've been cheating about this , " he said 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " the cheating has gone on for a long time 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " the @entity23 has previously admitted that 23 veterans passed away because of delays , and 53 others had adverse health effects at @entity23 facilities across the country 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 sources now tell @entity1 the @entity119 is investigating in six states , including @entity121 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity24 also testified before a @entity51 committee and said he had no intention of stepping down , but a top department official did so a day later 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 dr	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity125 , undersecretary for health in the @entity15 , had appeared before the congressional panel alongside the secretary 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 @entity89 , among others , applauded that move 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 but as far as @entity24 's status , @entity89 said the secretary for now should stay 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " if we switch secretaries then the focus will get away from fixing the problem to who 's the new secretary going to be , " he said 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " and then he 'll have three - or six - month or a nine - month grace period because he 's the new guy 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 our best bet at this point is to keep the ( current ) secretary on board , but i think the president needs to keep him on a pretty short leash and be sure that he 's doing the job 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " that was echoed by a leading veterans group 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " we demand swift accountability , " said @entity149 , a deputy director at the @entity150 , on " @entity99 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " " the families who have been affected by these allegations need justice and need it quickly 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " other leading groups have taken a harder stance , reiterating calls for a sweeping change at the top of the department 's leadership 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " we called for the secretary and two undersecretaries to step down , " said @entity162 , national commander of the @entity163 , on @entity165 's " @entity164 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " he noted @entity125 was already scheduled to retire this year , and a replacement had earlier been nominated 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " this seems to us to be business as usual 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 we have n't seen that proactive versus reactive culture of change we 'd like to see 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " @entity89 told @entity1 earlier that the @entity23 had been keeping secret lists of delayed appointments , while providing top officials with sham figures 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " they would n't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times , " @entity89 , who worked at the facility for 24 years , said last month in an exclusive interview 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " so then when they did that , they would report to @entity0 , ' oh , yeah 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 we 're making our appointments within 10 days , within the 14 - day frame , ' when in reality it had been six , nine , in some cases 21 months 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " the @entity51 has tried to manage the crisis , repeating in recent days the president 's earlier order that @entity24 conduct a review of the @entity199 's practices at its facilities 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " the president is madder than hell , and i 've got the scars to prove it , given the briefings i 've given the president , the conversations that we have had on these matters , " said @entity51 chief of staff @entity201 on @entity165 's " @entity164 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " " at the same time that we 're looking at accountability we want to continue to perform to provide our veterans the services that they have earned 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " but the @entity163 says @entity214 himself has been missing in action 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " we need the @entity51 , the president to come forward 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 he needs to make a statement to show the employees of @entity23 that this needs to change now , " said @entity162 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " one death is tragic , but when you hide it , that 's unforgivable 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 " @entity24 told lawmakers last week the incidents were " isolated , " but @entity1 sources relate another story -- that the @entity23 inspector general 's office has been investigating allegations in at least half a dozen states 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 sources have told @entity1 investigative correspondent @entity234 that other whistle - blowers have come forward from across the country , saying their offices manipulate wait times as well 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
 the @entity23 has admitted 23 people in nine states have died because of delayed care -- many of them veterans who were forced to wait too long for simple tests like colonoscopies or endoscopies 	@entity51 chief of staff says @placeholder is " madder than hell " about @entity23 scandal
