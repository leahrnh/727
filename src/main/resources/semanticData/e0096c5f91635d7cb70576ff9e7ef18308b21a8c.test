" we are determined to prevent @entity1 from acquiring nuclear weapons 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 " so said president @entity3 on friday at the annual general assembly of the @entity5 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 as presidential sentences go , it 's an artfully constructed one 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 it 's not a statement about @entity1 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 it 's not a statement about nuclear weapons 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 it 's a statement about the president 's feelings 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 as such , the statement arrives with a built - in loophole 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 " ( @entity19 ) e have imposed the most comprehensive , the hardest - hitting sanctions that the @entity1 regime has ever faced 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 " that sentence , from the same speech , is likewise literally true 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the president has somewhat tightened the sanctions already in place when he entered office 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 so yes , the sanctions now in place are the " hardest - hitting " the regime " has ever faced 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 " on the other hand , despite the tightening , the sanctions remain pitifully inadequate to the job 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity1 's most crucial import is gasoline , because this oil - producing nation can not refine enough gasoline for its automobiles 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 gasoline imports to @entity1 are supposedly sanctioned 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 despite sanctions , @entity1 has increased its imports of gasoline over the past 90 days , according to news reports 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 as sanctions fail to bait , the options on halting @entity1 's nuclear program get uglier 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 somebody ( @entity50 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity1 dissidents backed by @entity49 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 ) is carrying out a campaign of violent sabotage against @entity1 's nuclear program 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 on november 12 , a huge explosion leveled an @entity1 missile base near @entity55 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity1 acknowledged the explosion killed several dozen people , including the head of its missile program 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 by some reports , the dead included a team of visiting @entity63 missile scientists 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 two weeks later , another huge explosion was heard near @entity65 , site of an @entity1 uranium enrichment facility 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 this time , however , the @entity1 regime offered no statement or details on the explosion 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 if any @entity73 government knows anything , that government is not sharing its information 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 over the past few years , there have been numerous reports of the assassination of @entity1 nuclear scientists , including one shot dead on a busy street by a motorcyclist in july 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 some foreign policy analysts suggest a policy of " containment " and " deterrence " of @entity1 's nuclear weapons 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 that policy seems incredibly unrealistic , given the @entity1 regime 's long history of reckless adventurism , including terrorist operations on the soil of ( among others ) : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity50 , @entity49 , @entity100 , the @entity101 and the @entity102 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 but even if containment and deterrence were realistic options , the situation has moved far past that point 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 there 's a covert war being waged apparently over the @entity1 nuclear program 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity1 is waging a brutal irregular campaign of its own : it 's suspected of being behind an assassination attempt against the @entity49 ambassador to the @entity102 ; it has given aid to @entity117 's @entity116 and to @entity118 in @entity98 and has aided insurgents in @entity120 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 and @entity1 's nuclear ambitions have unleashed a cycle that will not be stable -- that is much more likely to end in open conflict than in a standoff 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 yet there is a leader pushing a plan that could end the cycle without war : @entity102 sen	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity131 , @entity132 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 for a year , the freshman senator has been urging a new approach to sanctions , an approach that truly would force an @entity1 rethink 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the @entity131 plan , co-sponsored by @entity139 , @entity140 , would impose sanctions on the @entity1 central bank , in effect severing @entity1 from the entire global payments system 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 specifically , the @entity146 amendment would forbid any @entity102 financial institution to deal with the @entity1 central bank -- or to deal with any financial institution that does so 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 every bank would find itself confronted with a stark threat : if you do business with @entity1 , you will lose access to the largest financial market on earth 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 these sanctions would collapse the central bank of @entity1 and shove the @entity1 economy onto a barter system for all external transactions 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the @entity146 amendment passed the @entity161 100 - 0 as an amendment to the @entity163 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 on friday , it passed the @entity165 and will now head to the president 's desk for his signature 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the @entity3 administration has opposed @entity170 for fear of roiling world oil markets 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity1 exports 2	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
5 million barrels per day 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 to put that figure in perspective , the @entity174 from @entity175 ( a decision on which the @entity3 administration has just postponed ) could have added 700,000 barrels per day to world exports , alone substituting for almost one - third of @entity1 exports 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 @entity183 and @entity99 have capacity to increase their production quickly and substantially , and of course the @entity102 government has 727 million barrels in the strategic petroleum reserve , more than ample to deal with supply shocks 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 still , to respond to administration concerns , the @entity146 amendment now empowers the president to issue waivers on both national security and economic grounds 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 most observers expect the president to sign the @entity163 legislation with the @entity146 amendment -- and then seek to evade the amendment 's requirements 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 he will certainly have the authority to do so 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 this evasion will however come at a political price 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the central bank sanctions in @entity146 begin to bite hard six months out --- i	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
e	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 , about the time of the @entity206 and @entity207 conventions 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 if the president is then granting waivers to banks that want to do business with @entity1 , that action will be visible and politically costly 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 the utmost irony here is that detractors in the administration and in the foreign policy establishment criticize @entity146 as a form of confrontation with @entity1 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
 in reality , @entity146 is the last and best chance for regional peace : the last best hope to avoid the horrible choice of either using force to stop @entity1 -- or acquiescing as @entity1 gains the power to wage nuclear terror against its neighbors and the world 	@entity242 : @entity3 should support @placeholder plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
