 on december 12 , 1997 , and went to change her son 's diaper 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 then she rocked him and laid her 10 - month - old back in his crib 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 later that morning , she went into his bedroom to wake him and found his lifeless body 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997

 she called 911 , but her baby boy was cold , and she knew in her heart he was already dead 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997

 thirteen years later , the commission voted wednesday in favor of new proposed mandatory standards for cribs 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 the new rules , likely to go into effect next year after a final vote by the federal commission , would render many cribs in the country as not up to code , regardless of whether the crib style and model was ever considered unsafe , and essentially would ban the manufacture and sale of drop - side cribs 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 in addition to eliminating drop - side cribs , the new rules will mandate better mattress support , sturdier hardware and better quality wood for crib construction 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 between november 2007 and april of this year , there were 36 deaths associated with crib structural problems , according to @entity29 chairwoman @entity56 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 hazards in cribs include faulty hardware , dangerous gaps created from mattress support failures , and poor wood quality with crib slats that can be broken easily 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
 the new standards aim to eliminate gaps where babies could become entrapped and suffocate , and to prevent babies from falling out of the crib 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997

 i had the baby monitor on , but it 's the silent killer 	@placeholder 's 10 - month - old son suffocated in a drop - side crib in 1997
