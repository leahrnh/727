( @entity0 ) -- over the course of more than 15 years , " @entity6 " has established a rich history as one of the video game world 's most storied franchises 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 sadly , " @entity6 : @entity6 " fails to add to that rich history , serving up ordinary squad - based game play and limited threats from the franchise 's iconic zombies 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the latest venture into the zombie - filled world by @entity14 is supposed to take place in time between between two other games in the series , " @entity17 " and " @entity6 : @entity18 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 " this time , you play as a member of the @entity22 squad for the always dubious @entity23 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 you 're tasked with retrieving a virus that turns people into the undead creatures before the @entity28 military can get it 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 @entity6 is the location where the zombie phenomena first occurred and has been the setting in many of the " @entity6 " games 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 working for the bad guys in this title was supposed to be a refreshing change from others in the series 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 and it might have worked , if the squad - based third - person shooter game did n't feel more like a poorly lit " @entity44 " than what we 've come to expect from the " @entity6 " franchise 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 each member of your squad specializes in a different field ( stealth , explosives , recon , etc	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 ) , and you play as one of four soldiers fighting their way through @entity6 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 either your friends can fill in the roles of the other three squad members or the game will control the others 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 you get to choose your special abilities and weapons at the beginning of each mission , but these are all locked down once the game starts 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the weapons are similar to those you 'd find in a first - person shooter , and your character can carry one sidearm and one long - barreled weapon 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 ammo and other weapons are sprinkled throughout the battleground and very rarely will you find yourself without bullets 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 there are a couple of high - powered , single - use weapons ( grenade launchers , flamethrower ) that ca n't be replenished with additional ammo 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 if you use one of these , make sure you can pick up another weapon as soon as you run out of fuel or grenades 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 one of the most frustrating aspects of combat is what i call " magnetic cover 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 " if you 're trying to use cover from your enemies while you 're moving , you end up essentially plastered to a wall if you get even close to it 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 forget about moving stealthily from one covered spot to another 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 if you want to progress , you have to stand up , exposing yourself to enemy fire , then move to the next safe spot 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the artificial intelligence that runs the game is fair , but its decisions are sometimes hard to understand 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 your squadmates will rush into a room with guns blazing at times when the team could have easily sneaked past 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 at other times , they will arbitrarily fling themselves to the ground for no apparent reason 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 at least they are good in a fight and and very effective at taking the heat off your character 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 be sure to have a medic in your squad to help heal injured party members 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 most of the opponents are not zombies 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 you 'll spend a lot of time battling the @entity28 military in firefights , not that the soldiers you face seem much smarter than the undead 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 character models for the soldiers and the zombies are reused often 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 you 'll see the same zombie police officer , zombie large guy and zombie girl in short - shorts over and over again 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 you will kill a lot of living and nonliving enemies in this game 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the experience points you gain can be used at the beginning of each mission to upgrade weapons or personal abilities 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 but , even if you do n't use any upgrades at all , you will still be able to succeed 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the passive abilities that help you find items and enemies on your mini-map are probably the most useful 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 none of the weapon upgrades felt like they were necessary 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 " @entity6 : @entity156 " ultimately comes off as a mundane , average shooter that abandons its heritage in the zombie / horror genre 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 there are n't enough zombies and too many living - breathing enemies to truly feel like a worthy outing for this franchise 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 the ending flies in the face of " @entity6 's " history and leaves more questions unanswered 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 it feels half - done with no real finale 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 obviously , the ending leaves the door open for another shooter in this series 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 unfortunately , it does n't really deserve one 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 " @entity6 : @entity156 " is currently available in @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 it will be available in @entity177 on april 26 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 it is available for @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 it is rated 'm for @entity183 ' due to blood and gore , intense violence , and strong language 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
 this review was done playing the @entity181 version 	reviewer : " @placeholder : @entity6 " not a worthy chapter in franchise
