 she ca n't sweat but she can shed tears 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder
 on the day we speak , her appearance raises few eyebrows at her local @entity21 in @entity22 -- she 's a familiar and well - known presence in the waterfront @entity0 town where she grew up 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder
 @entity3 's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people 's reactions to it has , at times , left her on the brink of suicide 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder

 i did n't trust them 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder
 " the worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom @entity3 thought was her friend 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder

 there 's even talk she might take part in a fashion show for people with visible difference , realizing a childhood dream 	abandoned at birth , @entity44 and @entity45 adopted @placeholder
