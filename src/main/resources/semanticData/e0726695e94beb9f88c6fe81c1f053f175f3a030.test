( @entity0 ) -- " sorry -- the sun is shining so i 've gone to sleep on a hill 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " when @entity5 leaves an " out of office " note , it 's for real 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 but these days , the @entity8 -- who once left his parents ' house and came back four years later after cycling around the world -- is finding adventure closer to home 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " originally i wanted to test myself , to see what i was capable of physically and mentally , and i suppose i wanted to try to make my mark for myself and on the world , " he tells @entity0 's @entity15 series 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " now it 's just more the curiosity of going to new places and the simplicity of life when you 're out on an expedition , and the contrast of the life out in the wild to the real world back home -- the urban , busy , hectic life which i also enjoy 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " so instead of trekking across @entity31 , running 150 miles through the @entity32 in a week , rowing the @entity33 , or sledding through the freezing @entity35 vistas of @entity36 , now the 37 - year - old is more likely to be leading a group of city slickers into the @entity41 wilderness -- and back in time for work on monday morning 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " to be able to leave @entity44 on the train , travel just for 40 minutes , climb up a big hill to a beautiful woodland , be surrounded by birdsong and fresh air and silence and just enjoy being out here , " he says 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " to cook on an open fire , sleep out underneath the stars , then wake up , smelling of smoke a little bit , a little disheveled perhaps , jump on the train , back into @entity44 , ready for another day at work , having had a real adventurous experience 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " @entity5 , who grew up near the natural splendor of the @entity60 in northern @entity61 , was a latecomer to adventuring 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 it was n't until he got to university that the travel bug bit 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " i was n't particularly an athletic or sporty child and i started to get into running up mountains , marathons , pushing myself harder , " he says 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " that 's when i came up with the idea of trying to cycle around the world 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 just after i finished university , i jumped on my bike with very little experience , no sponsors and no real likelihood of success and i waved goodbye to all my friends and family 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " four years later , he 'd cycled 46,000 miles through 60 countries and five continents -- on a budget of just $ 10,000 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 since then he 's tackled more specific challenges on sand , snow and sea , all the while seeking to push his boundaries 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " i deliberately choose projects that i 'm not an expert at and so everything i do , i begin quite intimidated , quite daunted , quite worried -- worried about failing , total disaster , " @entity5 says 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " i do n't really like finishing expeditions 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 once i finish something and i know i can do it , i lose interest really and i start to think about what might be next 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " although his trips are physically grueling -- he was cycling 120 miles a day by the end of his global journey -- @entity5 says the main challenges are mental 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " most trips i do , there 's usually some point during it when i just sit down , often just burst into tears and just think , ' i ca n't do this 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 ' if i just persuade myself to get up and keep going for a little bit longer , then i do it -- and i think that 's the real appeal of adventure and certainly one of the addictive sides to it , " he says 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " it 's the realization that you 're capable of more than you ever imagined 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 it 's also a bit of a @entity117 -- you open up and think , " wow , if i did that , what can i do next 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " i 'm not sure there 's an end point 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " while he loves the solitude of being alone in the great outdoors , @entity5 also appreciates being able to share the experience -- as he did with two friends when they went to @entity36 in 2012 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " it 's an amazing moment to stand there and watch the plane fly away and be left in total silence , no - one around for hundreds of hundreds of miles , " he recalls 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " it 's very cold , you 're trying to operate camera equipment , temperatures minus 20 , minus 30 -- really hard fiddly work , freezing cold fingers 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 we were putting in long days , pulling the sledge for long , long days 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " we were trying to push ourselves as hard as we could and also you 're trying to build up a relationship -- you know the guys are mentally worrying , ' am i slowing them down 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 are they slowing me down 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 ' " the physical exhaustion of trying to do it -- it takes hours to try to melt enough water to drink for the day , so it 's a grinding daily routine 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " while early 20th century explorers such as @entity150 and @entity151 were discovering uncharted territories , @entity5 concedes that modern adventures mostly provide more personal achievements 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " the phrase ' pointless but meaningful ' is one that i really like to view my adventures through because in one sense , cycling around the world , or walking across a desert or skiing in some ice cap in @entity36 is pointless these days -- we have technology and vehicles that do it far more efficiently , " he says 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " we 're not actually doing anything of ' use ' in the most literal sense and yet there 's definitely something that to me feels meaningful 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 adventure has added so much to my life -- knowledge of the world , knowledge of myself , perspective and balance about the modern world that i live in back home 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " in 2012 , he was named @entity182 's @entity181 after a series of mini-expeditions around @entity41 , and has written extensively about his experiences 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 and it 's this understanding of how we fit into the world that he hopes his microadventures will give to people weary of the city rat race 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " @entity191 are my attempt to try to help normal people in the real world get the enjoyment out of adventures that i 've had over many years , " @entity5 explains 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " i wanted to get the essence of adventure , the wilderness , the challenge , the escape from urban life , all these things that are really important to me , and condense them down into something small and achievable for normal people with real lives 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " you can escape -- if only for one night -- and find nature , wilderness , a bit of peace and then go back to your normal life with a slightly shifted perspective 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
 " so get working on your own " out of office " message now , there 's a whole world to explore 	the 37 - year - old was @entity182 " @placeholder " in 2012
