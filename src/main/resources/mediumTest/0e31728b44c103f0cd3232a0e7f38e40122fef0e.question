@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) a man stands on a beach in a distant land . waves lap his ankles . he wades through the gentle dawn light , arms outstretched , his head held high . he is fully dressed ; not a tourist but a freedom fighter . a photograph of this man , beamed around the world , becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty . it is 2015 . the man is @entity23 . if you thought the man might have been an @entity25 on the shores of @entity27 , such is the power of persuasion . it 's easy to lead a horse to water when , in the centenary year of the @entity27 campaign , our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance . the sum total of television programming , beer advertising , political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of @entity0 's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation : young ( white ) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice . there is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead . last weekend i planted @entity27 rosemary in my backyard ; part of the proceeds go to the @entity59 , a national project to preserve and restore @entity0 's living memorials . more objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game . to widen the scope of historical tribute , and also recall the words and deeds of the @entity0 men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment , is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive . but the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped @entity0 asunder . even at the time , the @entity74 itself was divisive , a historical reality belied by today 's bland , blanket coverage of " the @entity78 " . @entity0 's participation in the war was contested from the outset . on august 11 , 1914 , veteran political campaigner @entity82 wrote in her woman @entity84 newspaper : " it is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of @entity86 that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict . " as she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage , @entity82 rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words . " the time has come for women to show that they , as givers of life , refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter . " @entity0 and @entity105 women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate : the vote . " the enfranchised women of @entity0 are political units in the @entity111 , " @entity82 argued , " and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts . " @entity82 's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace . under the newly legislated @entity117 , the @entity84 suffered censorship , leading @entity82 and her women 's @entity119 to fight on multiple fronts : " we are fighting for @entity122 and against @entity123 . " around the nation , trade unionists opposed to " the capitalist war " joined the movement . @entity0 had the only entirely voluntary military service among the @entity130 forces ; less than 40 % of eligible men signed up to fight " for @entity132 . " as the carnage at @entity27 brought home the realities of war , recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread . general strikes halted industry , as workers reacted to the food shortages , unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of " the @entity146 . " with enlistments falling away in 1916 , prime minister @entity147 pushed for conscription and pushed through the @entity150 . groups that voiced opposition to the war , like the @entity154 , were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material " likely to cause disaffection or alarm " . when waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike , the @entity117 was invoked to send them back to work . in september 1916 , the @entity163 were arrested and tried for treason . " fifteen years for 15 words " was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment . the conscription referendums of october 28 , 1916 , and december 20 , 1917 , became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war — or the federal government 's domestic policies . there were diverse reasons for that opposition , including the @entity180 sentiments of @entity181 . in @entity1 , the meeting place for such public debate was @entity184 , a pocket of land nestled between what today is @entity187 and the @entity188 . anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown @entity192 . most protest meetings were peaceful , but one became infamously violent . " riotous scenes at @entity184 " , headlines around the nation proclaimed , when a demonstration organized by the @entity199 in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers . both conscription referendums ultimately failed . the @entity205 contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists , many of whom went to jail , including @entity82 's compatriots @entity211 and @entity213 . @entity213 was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at @entity184 in 1918 . she is reputedly the first @entity0 prisoner to go on a hunger strike . other protesters were deported . as historian @entity222 reminds us : " it does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide . " the enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of @entity27 , manifested not only in the " shattered @entity231 " whose families bore the burden of care , but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped @entity0 's social and political relations in the 20th century . lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , freedom of speech — were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much , but are still accorded little recognition . perhaps , by the 125th anniversary of the @entity27 campaign , when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives , we will come to associate riverbanks , as well as beaches , with the potent ebb and flow of freedom . copyright 2015 @entity253 . some rights reserved .
