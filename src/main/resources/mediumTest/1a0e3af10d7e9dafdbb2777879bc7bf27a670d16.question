@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) they were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters , friends and fellow citizens . they were students and dreamers , pursuing their ambition for a better life . and on tuesday night , @entity1 remembered them as innocent victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation and left communities heartbroken . the gathering started with quiet chatter among a crowd of hundreds before mourners went silent and moved toward one end of @entity0 's @entity21 . organizers unloaded 147 crosses from a truck and quietly planted them in the ground . mourners read names of some of the victims as candles flickered in the dark . the crowd then sang the national anthem . the attack at a university in @entity36 on thursday killed 147 people , mostly students . the @entity39 militant group claimed responsibility . as the country mourned the victims , others took to social media to humanize them by sharing their stories . they talked about aspiring lawyers , doctors and teachers . " i ca n't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying , " said @entity49 , 32 , who lives in @entity50 , hundreds of miles from @entity36 . " they were just children . they were trying to make a better life for themselves . some were first to go to college in their communities . they died trying to get an education . " using the hashtag # 147notjustanumber , @entity1 used social media to talk about the lives of the victims . they shared pictures of beaming faces , full of life and energy , in happier days . they talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children 's bodies . " we need to talk about the bright futures cut short , " said @entity74 , who organized the vigil . " today 's meeting will be a calling to say , ' we need to remember the 147 ; they are not just a number . ' we are trying to avoid remembering these people as just a number . " some students remain unaccounted for , and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues . @entity1 authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims . at @entity21 , right next to the crosses , a bulletin board featured 32 photos of the young students . " with the previous attacks , there 's been a sense of the victims just being numbers , " @entity96 said . " the idea behind this is to have faces behind the numbers . we need to hear their stories , their dreams . " @entity110 said she got some solace from the vigil . " in 2010 , i was in a grenade attack in downtown @entity0 and every time there 's a terrorist attack , it hits too close to home , " @entity110 said . " it 's not just happened to me , but many others . " the vigil was important for the healing process , she said , because " we should n't have people walking around with scars . " it was the deadliest attack in the nation since @entity127 killed more than 200 people at the @entity129 in @entity0 in 1998 . in the @entity36 attack , the terrorists separated @entity132 from @entity133 , making some recite verses from the @entity135 . those who could n't quote the holy book tried to flee the gunfire , but whizzing bullets sent them to the ground . others scampered into closets and stayed there for hours . images from the scene showed heaps of students , faces down , lying in pools of blood . " those images will haunt us forever , " said @entity149 , 29 , who lives in @entity0 . " as a nation , we should never let this happen . we just ca n't . " @entity1 launched airstrikes monday targeting @entity39 's training camps in @entity156 , according to a military source , adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at the university . " the latest attack of @entity39 bases by the @entity1 military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 . it is not a retaliation to the @entity36 attack . the operation has been ongoing , " the source said monday . @entity1 authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in @entity36 could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in @entity0 for hours after the massacre awaiting transport , a police source said monday . it 's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the @entity1 capital about 230 miles ( 370 kilometers ) west of the attack . @entity1 politicians and @entity0 - based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did . once the team entered the university complex , the hourslong siege was quickly defused . but a government spokesman defended the response time . " with the benefit of hindsight , you can always say things could have been done better , " said @entity193 , a spokesman for @entity1 president @entity194 . however , he added , @entity1 authorities " got the job done " and saved lives . foreign minister @entity201 echoed that sentiment in an interview with @entity2 on monday . she denied reports that an elite rapid response team single - handedly ended the siege . " we have a military garrison in @entity36 , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists . so the response was adequate , " she said . " we did everything that we could do . " @entity1 's @entity219 named @entity220 as the organizer of the attack . the senior @entity39 leader is also known by the aliases @entity226 and @entity227 , it said . the ministry offered a reward of 20 million @entity1 shillings , or about $ 215,000 , for information on his whereabouts . he is in charge of external operations against @entity1 , according to a government document , and commands the militia along the border . another terrorist involved in the attacks is @entity243 , a @entity1 - @entity156 and the son of a government chief in @entity246 , authorities said . @entity246 is in northern @entity1 . dorm becomes scene of a slaughter @entity39 is based in @entity156 , and its violence has spread to @entity1 before . in 2013 , militants attacked @entity0 's upscale @entity252 , leaving 67 people dead . the terror group has intensified attacks in @entity1 since the country sent troops to @entity156 four years ago to help battle the militants . @entity2 's @entity259 and @entity260 reported from @entity0 , and @entity261 reported and wrote from @entity262 . @entity2 's @entity263 contributed from @entity264 .
