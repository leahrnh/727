@entity5 , @entity1 ( @entity6 ) the @entity1 prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of @entity4 insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . @entity5 prosecutor @entity10 told @entity6 that " so far no videos were used in the crash investigation . " he added , " a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . " @entity10 's comments follow claims by two magazines , @entity20 daily @entity19 and @entity1 @entity21 , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board @entity24 as it crashed into the @entity26 . all 150 on board were killed . @entity21 and @entity19 reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . the two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . " one can hear cries of ' my @entity38 ' in several languages , " @entity21 reported . " @entity40 can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . " " it is a very disturbing scene , " said @entity50 , editor - in - chief of @entity19 online . an official with @entity1 's accident investigation agency , the @entity55 , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. @entity58 , a @entity1 @entity59 spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the @entity4 crash site , told @entity6 that the reports were " completely wrong " and " unwarranted . " cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they " had n't been exploited yet . " @entity58 said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the @entity67 in @entity68 , near @entity69 , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand - in - hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , @entity58 said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , @entity58 answered with a categorical " no. " @entity50 told " @entity80 : @entity81 " that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying @entity19 and @entity21 are " very confident " that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after @entity19 and @entity21 published their reports . " that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , " he said . what was mental state of @entity4 co-pilot ? @entity20 airline @entity100 confirmed tuesday that co-pilot @entity101 had battled depression years before he took the controls of @entity24 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the @entity26 . @entity101 told his @entity100 flight training school in 2009 that he had a " previous episode of severe depression , " the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between @entity101 and the school discovered in an internal investigation , @entity100 said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that @entity100 , the parent company of @entity4 , knew of @entity101 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . @entity100 , whose ceo @entity118 previously said @entity101 was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a " swift and seamless clarification " and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . @entity118 traveled to the crash site wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . he saw the crisis center set up in @entity133 , laid a wreath in the village of @entity136 , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . @entity58 told @entity6 late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . @entity1 president @entity143 , speaking tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . in the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start wednesday , @entity58 said . among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . check out the latest from our correspondents the details about @entity101 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and @entity101 's possible motive for downing the jet . a @entity100 spokesperson told @entity6 on tuesday that @entity101 had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and " held all the licenses required . " earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in @entity177 , @entity178 , said medical records reveal @entity101 suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . @entity178 emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting @entity101 was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether @entity101 feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a @entity190 government official briefed on the investigation told @entity6 on tuesday . while flying was " a big part of his life , " the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told @entity6 that authorities believe the primary motive for @entity206 to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . @entity101 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the @entity190 government official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said @entity221 , a forensic psychologist . " psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , " he said . " but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems . " @entity4 crash compensation : what we know who was the captain of @entity4 9525 ? @entity6 's @entity245 reported from @entity5 and @entity246 from @entity177 , while @entity247 wrote from @entity248 . @entity6 's @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .
