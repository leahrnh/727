@entity3 , @entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 sits in a dark bar on a blindingly sunny @entity3 day . " hey man , " he says with a smoker 's rasp and a nod that indicates he knows you have been looking for him . but then a lot of people have been looking for @entity0 for a long time . for 43 years @entity2 has provided refuge for @entity0 from facing charges that he killed a @entity16 police officer and hijacked an airliner to @entity3 . @entity0 , now 65 , decided to give @entity1 an interview after we 'd spent two years trying to reach him . he wants to discuss how for the first time he is considering leaving his safe haven and returning to the @entity22 . before talking more , @entity0 finishes his plastic glass of beer and takes a final draw on his stub of a cigarette . we step out into the sunlight and go to a park where @entity0 starts to give his reasons why he may soon end his long run from the law . " i miss my country , " he said , his voice cracking . " i miss my family . i would like to go back and see where my grandparents were born , where i was born , where i went to junior high . eat some blackberry pie . even go to @entity41 's . that 's only natural . " @entity0 was a black power militant and said he is still a revolutionary . but he craves the kind of @entity46 fries that only capitalism can make . after five decades of @entity49 - era mistrust , the @entity22 and @entity2 are working to re-establish full diplomatic ties , but cases like @entity0 's present an obstacle to an improved relationship . @entity16 , where @entity0 's case has been open for decades , followed up on the shift in policy from the @entity58 administration with gov. @entity59 asking @entity60 to pursue @entity0 's extradition . critics of the new opening to @entity2 say @entity3 's harboring of fugitives like @entity0 is enough of a reason to maintain a hard line against the government of @entity69 and keep @entity2 on the @entity71 list of countries that support terrorism . @entity71 recommends removing @entity2 from terrorism list @entity0 , now 65 , may extradite himself first , saying the warming of relations between the @entity22 and @entity2 could mean an end to what he calls his " exile " on the communist - run , @entity81 island , even if his return brings jail time . @entity16 police chief @entity84 said he welcomed the news of @entity0 's possible surrender . " i understand that the social environment was very different in 1971 than it is today . i encourage him to return to face the charges against him on the state level and on the federal level and end his self - imposed exile in @entity2 . " @entity0 's journey began on november 8 , 1971 , when he and two other men -- @entity96 and @entity97 -- were pulled over on @entity98 outside @entity99 , @entity16 , in the middle of a cross-country drive . all three men were members of the @entity103 , a black power militant group that sought to break off @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 into a separate nation for african - americans . they were on the way from @entity113 to the @entity109 with a car loaded with weapons to support the cause . @entity16 state police officer @entity117 pulled over their rented @entity119 sedan , on suspicion that the car was stolen , said @entity84 . at 10:41 p.m. , @entity117 called in the @entity113 license plate of the militants ' car , according to the @entity16 @entity124 . fourteen minutes later the dispatcher radioed @entity117 back but was unable to reach him . a police officer arriving at the scene found @entity117 's body lying face down on the road , @entity84 said . there was a single bullet wound to his throat . @entity117 gripped his flashlight with one hand and his gun with the other , according to the records of the @entity16 @entity124 . the sedan was found the next day abandoned with three military rifles , a 12 - gauge shotgun , " revolutionary literature , " bomb - making materials and hundreds of rounds of ammunition @entity0 copped to riding in the sedan that @entity146 pulled over but refused to say who shot the policeman . " i am not a cop killer . i am a freedom fighter , " @entity0 said . " i am a @entity150 vet and people never ask me if i killed @entity152 because that was authorized by the @entity22 government . i dedicated myself to liberating my people . " for 19 days , @entity0 said , the men hid out in the @entity16 desert , working on an escape plan as 250 law enforcement officers closed in . " we had to go into exile so we hijacked a plane , " @entity0 said . the three men , @entity84 said , commandeered a tow truck at gunpoint , crashed through a fence onto the runway of @entity166 and ran up the gangway to @entity168 106 . @entity169 was a flight attendant aboard the @entity170 when the fugitives stormed aboard . " they were dirty and stunk from hiding out in the hills , " she told @entity1 from her home in @entity173 . @entity169 , now 72 , said @entity0 put a blade to her throat . " he told me to do what he said because ' this is no butter knife . ' i told him , ' well , i am no piece of bread . ' " @entity0 laughed , she said , and lowered the knife . hijacker @entity96 glowered and pointed a pistol at the flight attendants , @entity169 said , a tremor of fear audible in her voice , as if the hijacking had just happened . " @entity96 said he would shoot us and that he had already killed a man , " @entity169 said . the hijackers ordered the crew to fly to @entity194 . informed the plane could n't fly that far , they changed their destination . take us to @entity2 , they told the pilot . the trio knew @entity2 would most likely let them stay . after seizing power in 1959 , @entity202 blasted @entity60 for failing to send back the @entity205 regime officials who streamed to @entity206 to escape @entity69 's revolutionary tribunals , effectively ending the extradition agreement between the two countries . a rash of airplane hijackings to the island soon followed . @entity2 became popular with leftist revolutionaries as well as common criminals seeking a country beyond the reach of @entity22 law enforcement . " if anything went down , you went to @entity2 , " @entity0 said . en route to @entity3 , flight attendant @entity169 said she served the men bottles of @entity223 beer . when they finished , she saved the bottles in airsickness bags so @entity22 law enforcement later would have their fingerprints . after landing , @entity169 said she last saw @entity0 and the other hijackers as @entity2 soldiers escorted them off the plane . years later , the flight attendant said she experienced flashbacks of the hijacking and sometimes prayed for @entity0 . " i think he is a lost soul , " she said . revolutionary @entity2 soon disappointed @entity0 . @entity2 officials denied his request for military training to fight with revolutionary groups in @entity194 . instead he was put to work cutting sugar cane , doing construction and administrating a clothing store . one of the many menial jobs he worked , he said , put him under the supervision of @entity246 , @entity202 's older brother . " he has a big beard and looks just like @entity202 , " @entity0 remembered . " he was good to us , made sure we were always well fed. " in 1996 , then - @entity16 rep. @entity250 traveled to @entity2 to discuss @entity0 's extradition with @entity202 . " i talked to @entity202 and he said , ' no way , under no circumstances would he turn them over , that they were legitimate fugitives , " @entity250 told @entity1 . " i got a very strong signal not only would i not be allowed to bring back @entity0 but i would n't even be allowed to talk to him . " @entity0 is now the last living member of the trio of hijackers . @entity22 officials said that @entity97 drowned in 1973 and @entity96 succumbed to throat cancer in 2005 . married and divorced twice in @entity2 , @entity0 has two children on the island and he worries about leaving them if he were to return to the @entity22 . but @entity0 said he wants to visit his daughter , who was 6 years old when he left , and who he has n't seen since . he dreams of meeting the five grandchildren he has in @entity22 . he 's gone as far as hiring a @entity16 attorney , in case he decides to negotiate a surrender . his @entity2 government pension is a meager $ 10 a month , he said . not nearly enough to support him or even buy toys for his 8 - year - old @entity2 son . @entity0 said he became a babalao , or santeria priest , but still has n't found peace . he admitted he smokes too many unfiltered @entity2 cigarettes and drinks too much cheap rum . and there 's always the possibility that the @entity2 government has held onto @entity0 and other @entity22 fugitives , simply waiting for the right moment to trade them to the @entity22 . he said he is fine with that fate . " they took me in , " he said . " if the @entity2 government feels me going is for the benefit of 12 million people , that 's my sacrifice . i do n't worry about that . " as the interview ends , @entity0 lights another cigarette . a group of @entity22 touring @entity3 in a 1950 's classic car pull up to the park . they have no idea they are feet away from a wanted fugitive , but as @entity0 would say , that 's @entity2 . @entity0 is n't interested in staying in touch . he does n't have a cell phone . too poor , he says . he wo n't say exactly where he lives in @entity3 . he has to be cautious . and as he walks off , once again , he is gone . a side of @entity2 not often seen

@entity0 contemplates returning to the @placeholder for family and blackberry pie
