( @entity0 ) chanting " no justice ! no peace ! " protesters rallied in @entity3 late tuesday , the same day police released the names of the officers involved in the arrest of @entity8 . @entity8 died of a spinal injury sunday , exactly one week after he was taken into custody . demonstrators marched to a local police station that was protected by barricades . one man was arrested after crossing that barricade , but the protest was peaceful . among the crowd were members of @entity8 's family , including his mother . she held her head and cried . many of the protesters clasped hands , and raised them in a show of support . " make some noise for @entity8 , " one man shouted into a megaphone . " we wo n't stop , " said another . " we have the power and , of course , today shows we have the numbers . " speaking to @entity0 's " @entity36 360 , " @entity3 mayor @entity35 said she understands where the protesters are coming from . she understands their frustration . " mr. @entity8 's family deserves justice , and our community deserves an opportunity to heal , to get better , and to make sure that something like this does n't happen again , " she said . earlier in the day , the @entity45 released the names of six police officers suspended with pay . they are : lt. @entity50 , 41 , who joined the department in 1997 ; officer @entity52 , 45 , who joined in 1999 ; sgt. @entity53 , 30 , who joined in 2010 ; officer @entity56 , 25 , who joined in 2012 ; officer @entity57 , 26 , who joined in 2012 ; and officer @entity58 , 29 , who joined in 2012 . after an " in - custody death , " it is standard procedure to release the names of officers involved , said @entity45 spokesman capt. @entity64 . it does n't mean the officers did anything wrong , nor does it mean that these were the only officers involved , he said . of the six officers , three were on bikes and initially approached @entity8 , another made eye contact with @entity8 , another officer joined in the arrest after it was initiated and one drove the police van , @entity64 said . the autopsy has n't yielded many answers in @entity8 's death -- in fact , it 's prompted more questions -- but @entity3 's mayor pledged tuesday to find out how the 25 - year - old died after being arrested a week prior . " i 'm going to make sure that as we get information that we can confirm , we 're going to put that information out in the public , " mayor @entity35 said . " i want people to understand that i have no interest in hiding information , holding back information . " she 's angry , she said , and among the questions she wants answered are : why did police stop @entity8 in the first place ? and why did arresting officers make what she called the mistake of not immediately requesting medical attention when @entity8 asked for it ? i " he was dragged a bit , but then you see him using his legs to get into the van , so he was able - bodied when he was in the van , and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van , he was unresponsive , " she said . challenged on the " able - bodied " remark -- video shows @entity8 's legs hanging listlessly as officers carry him by his shoulders -- @entity35 said the medical examiner would make the final determination , but " we know he was fine getting into the van . " " we will get to the bottom of it , and we will go where the facts lead us , " she said . " we will hold people accountable if we find there was wrongdoing . " she further said she " absolutely believes we need to have an outside investigation , " especially when @entity3 's dark history of police misconduct is considered . police plan to conclude their investigation by friday , may 1 . from there , the case will go to the state 's attorney 's office , which will decide whether to file charges . the @entity133 has been watching developments in the @entity8 case and is officially looking into whether a prosecutable civil rights violation occurred , a spokesperson said tuesday . in october , the @entity133 announced a collaborative reform initiative with the @entity45 to " include an assessment of policies , training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens . " police brutality not on rise ; coverage is " when law enforcement misconduct is uncovered , the @entity150 @entity133 has a variety of tools available to respond . responses to misconduct in law enforcement organizations fall along a continuum of intervention , with the specific response calibrated to address the particular circumstances of any given situation , " @entity154 , director of the @entity133 's @entity155 , said in a statement at the time . the @entity133 began the data - gathering stage of the lengthy process in january and held its first public town hall last week at @entity168 . it was attended by hundreds of residents , many of whom sounded off about their experiences with @entity3 police . " right now , we are past the stage of implementing policies and procedures . this is a state of emergency right now , " @entity178 told @entity133 officials , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity180 . @entity178 ' brother , @entity183 , died in police custody in 2013 . the mayor issued a statement ahead of the town hall , saying that 230 officers accused of misconduct between january 2012 and february 2015 had accepted punishment outright , while another 61 officers were found guilty through trial board hearings . @entity45 is the nation 's eighth - largest police force with almost 4,000 civilian and sworn personnel . " i am determined to not allow a small handful of bad actors tarnish the reputation of the overwhelming majority of police officers putting their lives in danger to make @entity3 a safer city , " @entity35 said in the statement . the mayor had asked the @entity133 to take a look at the police department , the @entity204 reported , saying that her request came on the heels of the newspaper 's report that the city had paid almost $ 6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011 . overwhelmingly , @entity220 reported , the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges . under @entity35 's watch , she said , the city has seen a decline in lawsuits , as well as reports of excessive force and discourtesy . " i went to @entity228 for tougher laws to hold cops accountable . i 'm fighting to bring back the trust between the police and the community , " she said . according to documents obtained monday , the april 12 incident began when @entity8 ran from police . while the court documents allege that one of the arresting officers , @entity57 , took @entity8 into custody after finding a switchblade in his pocket , the @entity8 family attorney called the allegation a " sideshow . " @entity8 was carrying a " pocket knife of legal size , " attorney @entity246 said . police never saw the knife and chased @entity8 only after he took off running , the attorney said . court documents said @entity8 " fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence . " " the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of ( @entity8 's ) front right pants pocket . the defendant was arrested without force or incident , " the documents say . " the knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted , one - hand - operated knife . " the mayor has questioned whether police should have pursued @entity8 in the first place . " it is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone . so , we still have questions , " @entity35 said . @entity8 was in perfect health until police chased and tackled him , @entity246 said . less than an hour later , he was on his way to a trauma clinic with a spinal injury , where he fell into a coma . the family has not seen the autopsy report yet , @entity246 said , and relatives are still waiting to take possession of @entity8 's body . the family intends to have a second , private autopsy conducted once @entity3 police turn over the body , the attorney said . police , according to their own timeline , spotted @entity8 , gave chase , caught him , cuffed him and requested a paddy wagon in fewer than four minutes . the transport van left with @entity8 about 11 minutes after that , police said , and another 30 minutes passed before " units request paramedics to the @entity296 to transport the suspect to an area hospital . " when cell phones began recording , @entity8 was already on the ground with three officers kneeling over him . he let out long screams . officers had encountered him a minute earlier in an area where drug deals and crime are common , deputy police commissioner @entity304 said . @entity8 has an extensive criminal history , which appears to be mostly drug - related . the officers called for a prisoner transport van . cell phone video taken from two positions showed officers lifting @entity8 , whose hands were cuffed , by his shoulders and dragging him to the back of the van . officers put more restraints on @entity8 inside the van , police said , while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking . that was at 8:54 a.m.b at 9:24 a.m. , police called an ambulance to pick @entity8 up . @entity246 and angry residents of @entity3 want to know what happened in those 30 minutes in between . police said @entity8 requested medical attention , including an inhaler , and an ambulance later took him to the @entity334 's @entity333 . " he lapsed into a coma , died , was resuscitated , stayed in a coma and on monday underwent extensive surgery at @entity333 to save his life , " @entity246 said . " he clung to life for seven days . " what we know and do n't know about @entity8 's death @entity0 's @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 and @entity349 contributed to this report .
