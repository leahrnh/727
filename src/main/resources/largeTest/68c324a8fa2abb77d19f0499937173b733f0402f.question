( @entity1 ) for five decades , @entity0 built an empire . the signature " hot yoga " bearing his name drew throngs of devotees , spawning studios teaching the practice all over the world . he became a spiritual leader and celebrity icon with a long list of famous followers and friends . but now , the @entity18 brand is in jeopardy , with some yoga studios dropping his name after the guru was accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students . responding to the allegations for the first time in an exclusive interview with @entity1 , @entity0 said he wanted to set the record straight . " i want to show you , " he said , " tell the truth to the world , that i never assaulted them . " @entity0 repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone , saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers . " women like me . women love me , " he said . " so if i really wanted to involve the women , i do n't have to assault the women . " he said he feels sorry for his accusers , claiming they 've been manipulated by lawyers to lie . " i have nothing against them . i do n't think they 're bad people . it 's not them saying that , " he said . " they are influenced by somebody . " but @entity0 's accusers say he 's the one who 's been lying . " this stuff that he 's teaching is really good stuff , but he 's hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people do n't believe he 's capable of hurting people , " said @entity54 , a former student who now accuses @entity0 of sexual assault . " he 's got to stop lying behind it . and he 's got to stop doing this to people . " @entity0 is the founder of @entity18 's @entity66 of @entity67 . he 's featured prominently on its website , which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room . with studios heated to 105 degrees , he credits the steamy , sweaty stretches with transforming people 's bodies and minds . he said he 's guided by a deep calling to help others . civil lawsuits filed in @entity81 tell the story of a different @entity0 , describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance . besides @entity54 's claim of sexual assault , five other women have come forward with civil lawsuits claiming @entity0 raped them . the @entity92 , without explanation , declined to pursue criminal charges in the cases . at first , @entity54 said , she felt @entity18 would be the answer to her years of back pain and depression . " it was really quite life - changing for me . ... i felt good for the first time in a while , " she said , describing her first class . @entity54 said her father helped her take out a $ 7,000 loan so she could attend @entity18 's teacher training . but within the first week , she said , one episode left her feeling uncomfortable . in a meeting in @entity0 's office , she said , the guru seemed to make an advance . " he said , ' what should we do about us ? we need to make this a relationship . ... i 've known you from a past life . ' it was instantly shocking . i felt like my whole system just sort of imploded , " she said . then , she said , @entity0 cornered her late one night , making it clear she had to sleep with him in order to advance her career . " he crawled on top of me and he put his hand on my , inside of my thigh , and the other hand he wrapped around me , and he was holding me there , " she said . " he told me that he needed somebody to be with him , to massage him , to brush his hair , to spend time with him , that he was lonely . and he said , ' and i need someone to , to have sex with me . ' " @entity0 , she said , claimed she 'd never win a yoga competition if he did n't have sex with her . " i pushed him off of me and i said , ' i can do this by myself . ' and he said , ' no you ca n't . there 's no way . ' and i got up and i left the room , " she said . in another instance , she said @entity0 pinned her against a door and sexually assaulted her when she was left alone with him late one night at a teacher training course . " i just remember i was terrified . i did n't want to be touched again . when i reached the door , he was there , " she said . " he was only in his boxers and a t - shirt . and he pushed himself up against me and held me up against the door , " she said . " and he just started kissing all over my chest and my body . and he pushed himself into me very hard . " ultimately , @entity54 said she was able to open the door and get away . @entity0 said @entity54 's claims are false . " it 's not truth . i do n't do that . i do n't have to , " he said . he said he makes it a practice to never be alone with any of his students . he repeatedly denied assaulting his accusers or ever having consensual sex with them . but when asked whether he 'd had sex with other students , he responded , " yes and no. " " i have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women , " said @entity0 , who said he 's been married to his wife for more than 30 years . " sometimes students , they commit suicide . lots of students of mine , they commit suicide because i will not have sex with them . " @entity18 claimed these encounters took place before he was married . but when asked for evidence , @entity18 's attorney advised him not to give @entity1 names . @entity184 , @entity0 's attorney , said there are plenty of reasons to doubt the accusers ' claims . " we know for a fact that these claims allegedly occurred years and years and years ago , and nobody ever came forward , " he said . " and yet , after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if they 've been a victim of @entity0 , all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims . " @entity203 , @entity54 's attorney , said that 's simply not true . when @entity54 started telling her story , he said , others were inspired to speak out . " when she came forward and went public , it attracted other people , and the other five plaintiffs to also have a modicum of confidence to discuss what had happened to them , " he said . @entity54 said she was inspired by her young daughter to come forward when she did . " she 's 5 now , 5Â½ . but when i looked at my little girl and all i could see was 10 years down the road , or 20 years down the road , and her being just like me , the only thing i could see was her getting raped and assaulted , " she said . @entity0 vowed to clear his name . but he said the damage has already been done to his family . he cries as he describes how his wife has responded to the allegations against him . " my wife never look at me anymore , " he said . " my children , my wife ... we only die once in our life . i 'm dying every day when i get up in the morning . " the situation , he said , has destroyed his family . " how can i share my heart , my spirit ? twenty - four hours a day , i work harder than any other human being . and this is the reward ? i 'm a rapist ? " he said . " shame on your culture , western culture . shame , shame . your job ( is ) to go and tell the world the truth . " @entity1 's @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .
