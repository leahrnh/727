( @entity0 ) a brutal raid on the @entity2 in @entity3 has left nearly 150 people dead -- including students -- and dozens more wounded . gunmen attacked the campus early thursday as morning prayers were underway , shooting indiscriminately and taking hostages before being killed by security forces , officials said . the @entity13 @entity12 in @entity14 said @entity16 militants have claimed responsibility . the harrowing attack comes just months after @entity16 militants murdered non-muslim workers in a @entity3 quarry . the terrorist group has been behind numerous attacks in the region . it has also recruited some @entity13 , particularly from the @entity26 - @entity13 community in @entity27 . @entity16 is a @entity26 group that the @entity13 designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008 . it wants to turn @entity26 into a fundamentalist @entity30 state , according to the @entity31 . the group has been blamed for attacks in @entity26 that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and @entity38 peacekeepers . it has a history of striking abroad , too . before admitting to the @entity3 quarry attack , @entity16 claimed responsibility for the july 2010 suicide bombings in @entity44 , @entity45 , that killed more than 70 people , including a @entity13 citizen , who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the @entity52 final soccer match . the total size of @entity16 is not clear . in 2011 , a @entity13 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said the group was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters . a @entity60 report identified one insurgent leader who is believed to command " an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters , " most of them @entity3 . and @entity16 has links to other organizations . in february 2012 , the group 's leader , @entity68 , and @entity70 leader @entity69 released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations . decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made @entity26 a target for radical @entity78 groups . @entity16 's predecessor was @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , which worked to create an @entity78 emirate in @entity26 . it was partially funded by former @entity70 leader @entity82 , according to the @entity31 . @entity80 , which the @entity83 designated as a terrorist group , strengthened after the fall in 1991 of @entity87 's military regime and during the years of lawlessness that ensued . in 2003 , a rift erupted between @entity80 's old guard -- which was seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members , who wanted to impose fundamental @entity30 rule . ( @entity16 means " the youth . " ) that strife led the younger members to ally with a group of @entity99 courts -- the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city . working together , the @entity97 and @entity16 gained control of @entity105 in 2006 . that sparked fears in neighboring @entity108 that violence would spill over there , according to the @entity31 . those fears -- combined with a request from @entity26 's transitional government -- led @entity108 forces to enter @entity26 in december 2006 to remove the @entity97 from power . and that move inflamed @entity16 , which then attacked @entity108 forces and gained control of parts of central and southern @entity26 , according to a 2011 case study by @entity119 , who was then with the @entity120 at the @entity121 . in 2011 , after attacks on tourist destinations in northern @entity3 blamed on @entity16 , the @entity3 government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern @entity26 . @entity108 troops have also crossed the border and expelled @entity16 from @entity129 , a strategic town midway between the @entity108 border and @entity105 . the group then targeted @entity38 soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks . a suicide bombing in march 2012 killed five people at the presidential palace . analysts say tension appears to have been growing within @entity16 between @entity26 and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered @entity26 in recent years to join the group . the group has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a @entity148 account and video production abilities . @entity16 has even made a video that 's as slickly produced as a reality tv show , complete with a hip - hop jihad voice and a startling message : " mortar by mortar , shell by shell , only going to stop when i send them to hell , " an unidentified voice raps in @entity155 . but @entity16 's enemies -- and alliances -- can shift . @entity165 , a former @entity16 fighter and prolific @entity155 - language propagandist for the group , said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with @entity16 " regarding matters of the @entity99 and matters of strategy " and feared for his life . @entity174 , whose real name is @entity176 , was reportedly killed in @entity26 by @entity16 . @entity0 was not able to confirm the report . finding replacements might not be difficult . sheikh @entity179 , a member of @entity181 's @entity26 community , said he knows of hundreds of young @entity26 men living in the @entity183 who returned to @entity26 for terrorist training . @entity16 has also " succeeded in recruiting a number of @entity13 to fight in @entity26 , most of whom are from @entity27 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity186 wrote in a @entity0 column . in 2008 , the @entity191 launched @entity192 , " a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to @entity26 to support @entity16 , " @entity186 wrote . the once - ragtag @entity70 affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse , raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion , illegal taxation and other " fees , " according to the 2011 @entity60 report . the @entity13 believed then that the group was coordinating with @entity70 groups in @entity205 and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad . in 2011 , it was generating " between $ 70 million and $ 100 million per year , from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports , taxes on goods and services , taxes in kind on domestic produce , ' jihad contributions , ' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation , " according to the report from the @entity226 on @entity26 and @entity227 . in 2011 , the @entity60 declared a famine in the southern @entity26 regions of @entity230 and @entity231 , and @entity16 reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine - stricken areas . that year , the @entity236 for @entity237 said @entity26 had the highest mortality rate in the world for children ages 4 and younger . about 258,000 @entity26 died in the famine between october 2010 and april 2012 , and half the victims were younger than 5 years old , according to a report from the @entity60 @entity244 and the @entity246 - funded @entity245 . the @entity13 has supported @entity60 - backed @entity248 forces fighting @entity16 and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group . it has also donated millions of dollars in aid . in september 2012 , @entity26 parliament members selected @entity253 as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation , which had not had a stable central government since @entity87 's overthrow 21 years earlier . but that did n't mean @entity16 was calling it quits . in january 2013 , @entity263 forces attempted to rescue a @entity263 intelligence commando held hostage in @entity26 by the group . the raid left the soldier dead , another soldier missing and 17 @entity78 fighters dead . but there has been political progress in @entity26 . in january 2013 , for the first time in more than two decades , the @entity13 granted official recognition to the @entity26 government . @entity0 's @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .

it claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at a @placeholder mall in september 2013
