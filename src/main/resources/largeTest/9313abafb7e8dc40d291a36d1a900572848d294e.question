( @entity1 ) thousands remain missing in @entity2 after a devastating earthquake struck the region on saturday . a majority of them are @entity2 , @entity8 and @entity9 residents , but a handful are adventurers , trekkers and vacationers who have not been heard from since the catastrophe . technology has played a huge role in helping families share their worries , ask for help and search for their missing loved ones . several organizations , such as @entity22 and the @entity23 , have published features about the missing on their websites . and on @entity28 , dozens of people have filed reports pleading for information that might help them locate their missing friends and relatives . the death toll in @entity2 is rising ; it has now surpassed more than 5,000 . though the news is mostly heartbreaking and worrisome , there have been stories of survival , of families reconnecting with loved ones days after the disaster . the walk of survival after hearing about devastation in @entity2 , @entity45 of @entity46 reached out to his nation 's embassy in @entity2 , made calls to old college contacts in @entity51 and posted pleas on social media to help find his younger sister @entity54 . @entity54 , 25 , was with a group of friends at @entity58 , a spa - like resort near the border with @entity9 . when the earthquake struck , she was getting ready for a group excursion , a canyon swing . she could see the ground splitting apart beneath her feet . what scared her most was seeing large boulders crashing down from the mountains above . she prayed she would n't be crushed . she ran from the toppling boulders and shielded herself . when the tremors subsided , @entity54 and her friends huddled together and camped on higher ground overnight , expecting to be rescued . when three days passed and no one came to their aid , the group decided to take their chances and leave the confines of the resort . the walk toward @entity80 was treacherous . the roads near the resort were mostly blocked or in bad shape because of a landslide . but the worst part was the smell of rotting flesh , which permeated the air as she passed countless villages flattened by the quake . " it was a walk of survival , " she said . " my brain refused to feel anything apart from putting one leg before the other until the mountains were left behind . " @entity54 hiked six hours through mountainous terrain toward @entity2 's capital . after navigating down tricky mountain slopes , she and her friends came across a village and hitched a ride on a local bus . she was able to connect with her family , nearly four days after the quake , from the airport in @entity80 while waiting for the next flight to @entity46 . she was exhausted . she had n't showered or slept since before the quake . when @entity45 got the call from his sister , he said it felt fantastic . " what was surprising is that her voice sounded very strong . it did n't seem like she had gone through a terrible episode in her life , " he said . there was little information dr. @entity121 and her husband , @entity122 , of @entity123 , were vacationing in @entity2 when the quake struck . her brother , @entity125 , got news of the disaster from a friend . it was n't until he heard the high casualty figures and reports about the avalanches that he started to get scared . he was prepared for the worst , knowing they were traveling to a @entity135 base camp in @entity2 . but that was basically all he knew . @entity125 combed through what little information his sister left for him before the trip , but it did n't include the name of the tour group or the hotel where they were staying . he took to social media and started emailing and calling hiking groups that operated in @entity2 , but no one was getting back to him . on sunday , he managed to get inside his sister 's apartment in @entity150 and find documents with information on the trekking company the pair were using . it was n't until that evening , after emailing the company , that he got a short reply saying that his sister and her husband were safe . but that was all the information he had , and he wanted to hear directly from his sister , so he took to @entity160 to see what other people were doing to track down loved ones . several strangers who were in the same location as the couple responded to his inquiries on social media , saying they were fine . " it was incredible to see people that were stranded themselves over there wanting to help me . at least now we knew they were safe , " he said . on monday , the couple left a voicemail for @entity122 's parents saying they were making their way to the @entity80 in hopes of catching a flight out . only one phone call left @entity184 , a @entity2 tour guide , was busy saturday morning , leading a tour group of 17 senior citizens -- nine @entity187 , five @entity188 and three @entity2 -- from @entity80 to @entity189 . they had stopped for lunch at @entity192 , just near the border , when the magnitude 7.8 quake struck . once the tremors eased , @entity184 noticed that his cell phone had died . his connection with the outside world had vanished . worse , he had a group of older travelers and a short supply of food and water . one @entity187 in the group had an international cell phone , but its battery was quickly dying . unable to contact anyone in the area , @entity184 made one last attempt , calling his daughter . thousands of miles away , in @entity214 , @entity213 picked up that call . her father explained the situation : the roads were blocked and there was no way to get back to @entity80 or enter into @entity189 . the only way to escape was by helicopter . @entity213 learned from the @entity187 embassy that a family had hired a private rescue team , working with the @entity2 army , to rescue the stranded tourists by helicopter , but the team was unable to land because of bad weather . other rescue and relief operations in the region have faced similar weather issues . crews planning to help those desperately in need are having to wait for storms to subside . @entity184 was told later that 23 people were rescued from the area and left on a bus headed for @entity80 , but she was n't sure if her father or his tour group were among them . " all the people in the group are 60 years old or older . my dad said two americans in the group were sick because of the weather and altitude , and since the people were older , they could n't walk to help , " she said . now she is anxiously waiting for the weather to clear , and hoping to hear her father 's voice again . if you are looking for someone , we invite you to share your story on @entity28 . see scenes from @entity2 after the earthquake @entity1 's @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .
