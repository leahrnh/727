( @entity0 ) -- it 's not often that the @entity2 holds a news conference late on a sunday night . especially an unscheduled one . so when it was announced , around 9:45 p.m. et on may 1 , that president @entity6 would be addressing the nation within the hour , you knew it had to be important . had there been a major development in @entity11 ? things had been heating up since @entity13 started intervening against @entity15 's forces . were @entity17 troops going into another part of the @entity20 world ? had there been another terrorist attack ? or was it the news that many @entity17 had been waiting on for nearly a decade : that @entity24 , leader of @entity25 , had finally been brought to justice for the tragic events of september 11 ? the @entity2 announcement provided no details , so it was up to everyone else to fill in the blank . speculation was rampant , especially online and on social media . what was so important that it could n't wait until morning ? by the time @entity6 finally spoke at 11:30 p.m. , the world already knew the news : " the @entity17 has conducted an operation that killed @entity24 , the leader of @entity25 and a terrorist who 's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women and children . " the president never had a chance to avoid the mother of all spoilers -- not with how fast news travels today . an hour before his speech , the cat was out of the bag , thanks to @entity54 , chief of staff for former defense secretary @entity55 . " so i 'm told by a reputable person they have killed @entity24 . hot damn , " @entity54 tweeted . it did n't take long after that for major news organizations to confirm that the news was indeed true : the most - wanted terrorist in the world was dead , eight years to the day after president @entity65 delivered his " @entity67 " speech . " it was an incredibly symbolic event , " said @entity68 , a professor of history and international relations at @entity71 . " it was closure to 9/11 . ... @entity25 had been pretty much degraded , but ( @entity24 ) was still on the run . " as confirmation quickly spread of @entity24 's death , emotional celebrations began taking place across the country . many were caught on camera . people in the nation 's capital flocked to the @entity2 , carrying @entity17 flags , singing the national anthem and cheering the news in front of television cameras . at a baseball game in @entity94 , fans of both teams stopped to chant " @entity17 , @entity17 ! " celebrations also were held at @entity97 's ground zero , the site of the former @entity99 . " i never thought this night would come , where we would actually capture or kill @entity24 . and , thank the @entity104 , he 's been eliminated , to put it politely , " said @entity103 , a retired @entity97 police officer . " a lot of us ... gave up . but it did come , and a lot of us are overjoyed that it happened . " ' the most intense 38 minutes of my life ' by the next morning , the national conversation had started to change . the emotional impact of the announcement was subsiding , and the public wanted more detail , more explanation . how did the @entity17 find @entity24 ? why was he killed and not captured ? who exactly killed him ? it was soon learned that an elite team of @entity119 had flown two helicopters into @entity121 , @entity122 , where @entity24 was living in a three - story compound with approximately two dozen people , including his relatives and one of his most trusted couriers . the @entity17 had been tracking the courier for years , and the @entity129 informed the president in september 2010 that @entity24 might be living at the compound , a $ 1 million home surrounded by large privacy walls topped with barbed wire . on april 29 , 2011 , after several meetings with his @entity136 , @entity6 authorized an attack on the compound . in an operation that lasted nearly 40 minutes , the @entity119 breached the compound 's walls and methodically went through the house , floor by floor . @entity24 and his wife were found on the third floor , @entity2 spokesman @entity145 said in a news conference . @entity145 said a seal fatally shot @entity24 when @entity24 made a threatening move . an iconic photo , released by the @entity2 , shows @entity6 , vice president @entity154 , secretary of state @entity155 , secretary of defense @entity156 and other officials in the @entity158 , following developments as the raid went down . @entity159 later called it " the most intense 38 minutes of my life . " today , there have already been several books written about the raid , and a movie is said to be in the works . " i think the fact that it was such a tremendous success was the reason that the administration decided to publicize it : ' we 're going to put out all the facts and let the chips fall where they may , ' " @entity68 said . " and , of course , the downside of that was that it really antagonized the @entity122 . " the @entity17 and @entity122 had been working together for years trying to track down @entity24 and fight extremists near the @entity178 border . but the @entity17 , fearing that a leak could jeopardize its mission and tip off @entity24 , kept its raid a complete secret from @entity122 . the @entity122 were outraged and humiliated by the blatant violation of their national sovereignty . @entity17 officials questioned their ally 's motivations , as @entity24 was " hiding in plain sight . " the @entity129 director at the time , @entity190 , told @entity17 lawmakers in a closed - door session that @entity122 officials were either " involved or incompetent , " adding that " neither is a good place to be . " photo debate continues from the raid , @entity17 forces retrieved 10 hard drives , five computers and more than 100 storage devices containing intelligence from @entity24 's compound , according to a senior @entity17 official . they also found some homemade videos , including one that shows a graying @entity24 , wrapped in a blanket , watching himself on a small television . " the fact that they killed ( @entity24 ) was significant , but they also demythologized him , " said @entity210 , author of " @entity24 : a biography . " " they revealed him to be a megalomaniac , in many ways kind of a petty individual . instead of this kind of great , powerful figure ... he looks like a bit of a narcissist . i think that , in some ways , was as important as actually killing him . it brought him down quite a bit it terms of his stature . " but perhaps the most talked about pieces of evidence from last year 's raid have yet to see the light of day : photos of a dead @entity24 . the administration decided to keep the photos classified , saying the graphic nature of the images would only incite further violence or be used for propaganda purposes . " we do n't trot this stuff out as trophies , " @entity6 told @entity240 . " we do n't need to spike the football . " however , many @entity17 , including prominent lawmakers , believe they have a right to see the images . and some people have another concern : how do they know @entity24 is dead if they ca n't see proof ? that is n't a concern of sen. @entity254 , one of several @entity256 members allowed to view the photos . the @entity259 @entity258 , @entity6 's opponent in the 2008 presidential election , said there was no doubt that @entity24 is dead . but the debate over the photos continues one year later . on friday , a federal judge turned down a request for release of the photos , saying there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure . the war on terror also continues . @entity24 's death might have underlined the weakened state of @entity25 , but affiliate groups , including the @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 , " remain committed to the group 's ideology , " said a @entity17 intelligence report released in january . " lone wolf " terrorists are a threat as well , as we 've seen recently in @entity286 and @entity287 . more : is the core of @entity25 on its last legs ? the threats , however , should be no surprise to @entity6 , who warned that there was still work to be done when he announced @entity24 's death a year ago . @entity24 's death " does not mark the end of our effort , " he said in his speech . " there 's no doubt that @entity25 will continue to pursue attacks against us . " we must -- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad . "

it has been one year since @entity24 was killed by @placeholder forces in @entity122
