@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 culture minister @entity3 said thursday he will not resign over accounts in a book he wrote in 2005 about paying to have sex with " boys " in @entity8 . @entity3 admitted to paying for sex with " boys " in his 2005 autobiography , " @entity11 . " in an interview with @entity1 television network @entity13 , @entity3 said he " absolutely condemn [ s ] sexual tourism , which is a disgrace , and ... pedophilia , " in which he insisted he has never participated . despite the use of the @entity1 word " garcon " in his 2005 book " @entity11 , " @entity3 , 62 , has previously said the term did not mean " little boys . " he said the males he paid for sex were his age , or maybe five years younger , but not underage -- and the relations were consensual . " anyway , you can recognize someone who 's 40 years old ... " he told @entity13 . a 40 - year - old man " does n't look like a minor , " he added , suggesting that his partners were middle - aged men . his actions , @entity3 said , were " without a doubt , an error , " but " a crime , no , " he said in the interview . despite recent calls to resign from the far - right @entity38 and the left - leaning @entity39 , @entity3 , who is openly gay , vowed to stay in his job . he said he met thursday morning with @entity1 president @entity42 , and that the president supports him . in a july interview with the weekly @entity1 news magazine @entity45 , @entity42 said he had read @entity3 's book , and found it " courageous and talented . " the controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after @entity3 deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker @entity54 , who fled the @entity55 in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13 - year - old girl . the culture minister told @entity13 that he was " too emotional " when he denounced the filmmaker 's arrest in @entity61 as " horrifying . " " to see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning , and to see him alone , imprisoned , when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored , that is to say , he was trapped , it 's absolutely horrifying , " he said october 4 , according to @entity63 . the far - right @entity38 organized an @entity70 demonstration in @entity0 on thursday evening . " send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency ! " the party 's web site said . the party 's vice president , @entity76 , has demanded @entity3 's resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts . @entity3 responded , saying , " it 's an honor to be dragged through the mud by the @entity38 . " @entity85 's acts of " sexual tourism " have left " a dark smudge " on the government , @entity76 said . the group is also gathering signatures on a petition , online and on paper , from those who want @entity3 to step down . " we really hope he will resign , " @entity38 communications director @entity94 told @entity2 . " it 's an embarrassment for our country , that our culture minister has done this . it affects our international image . it 's not right , " he added . watch report on the controversy surrounding @entity1 culture minister @entity3 Â» on the other side of the political spectrum , the left - leaning @entity39 suggested @entity42 should consider @entity3 's position . " it 's up to president @entity42 to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism , and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce , " said party spokesman @entity109 . " if everything is relative and mr. @entity3 can be excused because he 's famous , well , i do n't excuse his behavior , " @entity109 said . @entity122 , the leader of the @entity39 , said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment . @entity3 said on @entity13 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the @entity1 word " garcons " -- but added , " you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality . " he also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others , and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism . the minister said he never had sex with " young boys " and denounced those who accused him of such acts , saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about . @entity3 told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked " little boys " were untrue . " it 's because when people say ' boys ' we imagine ' little boys , ' " he said then . " how to explain that ? it belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us , which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation . it has nothing to do with that . " @entity3 was a television personality , not a government minister , when the book was published . it caused a stir upon its publication , as well , and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then . in one passage , published by the @entity1 newspaper @entity175 on thursday , @entity3 describes in detail a sexual encounter with a " boy " he said was called @entity180 . " my boy did n't say a word , he stood before me , immobile , his eyes still straight ahead and a half - smile on his lips . i wanted him so badly i was trembling , " he wrote . @entity3 also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in @entity8 -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment . " most of them are young , handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them . i would learn later that they did n't come every night , that they were often students , had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families , who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner 's earnings , " the book said . " some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers , who also had their fans . it was the artistic side of the exposition : their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out . " he also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of " le commerce des garcons " ( the boy trade ) -- the misery , the piles of money from which " les gosses " ( the kids ) got only a few crumbs , the ravages of drugs -- " all of these rituals of the fair of the youths , the slave market , excited me enormously . " " the profusion of very attractive boys , immediately available , put me in a state of desire that i no longer had to restrain or conceal . " @entity3 -- the nephew of the @entity39 former president @entity85 -- joined @entity42 's center - right government this summer . @entity240 , the user - edited online reference web site , has locked down @entity3 's entry , preventing changes to it , in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him . @entity2 's @entity248 in @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity249 in @entity250 , @entity251 , contributed to this report .
