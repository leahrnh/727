every day in his cell in one of the most notorious prisons in @entity5 , an @entity1 father wrote a letter to his little boy . @entity8 would tuck the papers away , trying to fight the fear that his son might grow up never knowing his dad . " @entity13 was my sunshine . my ray of hope . when i was in there -- it was dark ... it was so ... hard ... i just imagined i could see him , " @entity8 told @entity20 on monday night via phone from @entity22 . @entity8 seemed to choke up a little . after all , he was speaking less than two days after gaining the freedom he thought he 'd never have again -- the result of a @entity28 court system ruling last week that his conviction could not stand . @entity8 took a breath and laughed . he lovingly shushed the loud giggles of his 5 - year - old . " come on , play ! " the boy said as he tugged at his father . @entity35 , from @entity36 , had been behind bars since november 2010 , when @entity28 authorities raided his real estate office in the coastal tourist city of @entity41 and accused him of money laundering , drug trafficking and involvement in organized crime . he was sentenced to 22 years in august 2011 . @entity8 survived " day by day , minute by minute , " he told @entity20 's @entity46 in an exclusive interview monday night . " it 's a fight for your life every second of the day , " he said . for nearly two years , a chorus of supporters -- including a former @entity55 agent , a @entity1 congressman and several noted human rights attorneys -- fought to clear @entity8 's name . they said that there was no evidence to support the charges and that the @entity1 's prosecution was rife with legal mistakes and misconduct . read the details of @entity35 's case earlier this summer , @entity35 's defense team presented their arguments before an appeals court in @entity28 , which decided last week to vacate all charges against him . one of @entity8 's attorneys picked him up from the notorious @entity76 prison near @entity77 late last week and drove him out of the gates . @entity8 immediately took a hot shower , and then another and another . the prison is notorious for its harsh treatment of inmates and for housing some of the region 's most violent criminals . @entity8 said he had been beaten and been refused water and food for days at a time and had developed a painful inflammation in his bowels and lost a lot of weight . @entity8 talked about the experience with @entity46 on monday night . " it is a notorious prison -- just the conditions and overcrowding of it and the danger of it . what is that first moment like when the gate slams behind you and you realize the reality of where you are ? " @entity46 asked . " i was with rapists , murderers and actual drug dealers , " @entity8 said . " it 's a very violent place . there 's a lot of tension between different groups in there ; not only the conditions , but the other people around you . " there were times , in the beginning , when @entity8 just could n't believe what was happening to him . " i did n't believe that i was there , and i kept thinking to myself , ' oh this is just a big mistake ' and that they will let me go any day now , " he said . " and the whole time , ' oh yeah , any day now i should be going , ' and it just kept dragging on and dragging on . " what is it like being a free man ? " it 's wonderful ... it 's very overwhelming , " @entity8 said . " but i 'm happy to be back with my family my wife and my son . ... it 's still very , very surreal . the whole experience has been very unbelievable . " he said that his sister @entity136 , a @entity137 lawyer who was his biggest advocate , sometimes was able to visit him in prison . she brought stacks of supportive e-mails . they were from friends and family but also from strangers who heard about his case through the awareness group @entity147 , which publicized his case . the e-mails were a huge help , but " there were days where i started losing hope , " he said . " it 's a very negative environment , that prison . " @entity35 meditated on his son . he thought about his @entity28 wife @entity156 . they met not long after he moved from @entity36 to the country , first to work as a @entity160 volunteer and then as a real estate agent . the couple settled in @entity41 , a popular beach town in southwest @entity28 . on november 11 , 2010 , @entity28 police raided @entity35 's @entity165 office and his home . police also took custody of @entity35 's truck and the clothes he was wearing ; yet 48 hours after he was detained , police asked him to put his clothes back on and get into his truck so authorities could take pictures , according to former @entity55 agent @entity174 , who has reviewed the case documents . he said police then claimed they found a substance that could be cocaine . " basic chain of command was not followed , " @entity174 , part of a group of vocal supporters , told @entity20 in february . " you can imagine you feel greatly violated that you are being accused of these horrific crimes with absolutely no evidence , " @entity8 told @entity46 . " but i just did n't believe that those things can happen . you do n't think that it can happen to you . " by late monday night , @entity8 was exhausted . he kept playing with @entity13 , though . he still has all those papers , the life lessons he wrote for his son . " i want to turn them into a book for him , " he told @entity20 . " i want him to be able to keep it . " he still loves @entity28 , he said . he does n't blame a country for the acts of a few people . he plans to go to graduate school to get a degree in sustainable urban development to do what he began in the @entity160 years ago . " i still do love @entity28 . i still believe in its potential . i still love the people there , " he said . " there 's wrongful convictions in every country around the world , including the @entity1 , so i ca n't isolate it just to @entity28 . and i hope that one day that i 'll be able to finish some of the social projects that i was working on . "
