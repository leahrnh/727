@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- basketball star @entity2 battled her way from the courts of @entity5 , @entity6 , to the upper echelons of the @entity8 to become one of the most popular women 's basketball players of all time . after retiring from play , @entity2 finds herself in a new fight -- to gain respect for her beloved sport . " it 's a constant battle , " she says . " i feel like i 'm an activist for women in sports . " marking its 17th season this year , the @entity8 is the country 's longest - running professional women 's sports league . but the quest for fans , sponsors and exposure in a sports world dominated by men can be slow , and tough . the league will celebrate the 27th annual @entity29 on wednesday , with several community events across the country . the occasion will honor female achievement in sports . but some say @entity37 attitudes have a long way to go . how women cracked tennis ' glass ceiling @entity2 was one of the pioneer players in the league . during her 12 seasons in the @entity8 , she won three @entity46 trophies -- not to mention four olympic gold medals . she also scored her place in women 's basketball history when she became the first professional player to slam dunk during a game back in 2002 . now , as co-owner of her former team , the @entity55 , she is looking for a slam dunk in the form of financial support . " it 's difficult to get corporate sponsors to really buy in and spend some of those corporate dollars on women 's sports , " she says . the @entity8 says that team sponsorships rose more than 10 percent in 2012 from the prior season . still , @entity2 calls her task tough , even with support from the @entity67 . @entity2 says the women 's league is growing , " but it would be nice to get more fans supporting the @entity8 and more women supporting women in sports . " top player @entity74 says there is an unfair attitude toward women 's sports in the @entity37 . " i do n't think we get a lot of media coverage the way that i wish we could , " she says . the center for the @entity83 was the @entity8 's @entity46 last season . still , speaking to @entity1 from @entity85 , @entity86 , where she is playing in the offseason , she says she is pleased with the @entity8 's progress , and that playing for the league has been a dream come true . " i think we have a lot to show with the way we play , " she says . " ... how hard we play , how competitive we are , just to show that there is another avenue for girls , another outlet for girls . " but building a fan base and profitability takes time . it also takes canny leadership . " we are in no way resting on our laurels , " says @entity8 president @entity103 , who came to the league in 2011 from @entity105 , where she was chief marketing officer . " but we do take some comfort in the fact that it takes a while to get a league and all teams up and running and to profitability . " expanding exposure is another challenge . @entity116 points to @entity118 's plan to broadcast the @entity8 draft in prime time this year . last year marked the first time @entity118 televised the draft lottery at all . experts agree that watching women play in a professional arena is inspiring for girls . and it helps convince them to play sports themselves -- a huge benefit for their development . " it 's really stunning , " says @entity132 , senior director of advocacy for the @entity134 . " the changes are profound for the rest of [ a girl 's ] life . " @entity132 , who won three gold medals as an @entity142 swimmer , says playing sports teaches girls about winning and losing , belonging to a team , and postponing short - term gratification for long - term rewards . she says that those skills " translate directly into tangible educational gains , and economic gains . " sports can also help teenagers during an awkward time in their development . @entity2 credits basketball with shaping her character , as well as her career . analysis : 40 years after @entity158 , more women in high school sports she started playing for a simple reason , she says : " i wanted to be popular . " but impressing her classmates was hardly the only benefit . " i found playing basketball really became the most important aspect of who i am today , " @entity2 says . " when you play sports , you 're more likely not to do drugs , you 're more likely not to have early pregnancy . " @entity8 players and executives alike see community outreach as part of the league 's mandate . @entity74 donated $ 32,000 of her own money to help build a school in @entity179 . @entity180 , co-owner and co-chairman of the @entity182 , says she was drawn to the league when she first saw a game . she thought there was a tremendous product , without the recognition it deserved . " it was the opportunity to solve that business challenge , " @entity180 says , " ... while being a part of the growing movement towards growth in professional women 's sports . " she credits her players with filling key roles in the community and helping to win fans among girls , and boys . by building awareness , women 's sports fans hope to create more support for women on the court . one of the most famous female athletes in the country , @entity209 , credits @entity158 , a 1972 law barring discrimination in school sports , for creating equal opportunities for girls . " with @entity158 , the opportunity for girls in sports is such a blessing , " says @entity209 . " i can never imagine the women who came before me , who did n't have the same opportunities that i had . " she broke records with her @entity142 heptathlon performances . now , she reaches out to young people through grassroots programs , like the @entity225 wellness program through the @entity227 . experts agree the race is n't over for equality in sports , particularly in the coaching industry . @entity132 says women are locked out of jobs that would have them coaching men at the university and professional levels . " it 's probably the most sex - segregated industry out there , " she says . " the industry of coaching men . it 's less than 2 % . " still , she 's optimistic about the future . " ( with ) those numbers ? " she says . " you can only go up . "
