( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 unveiled a collection of new @entity4 devices in @entity5 , @entity6 , on thursday . there were two dedicated e-readers and three @entity10 tablets , ranging in price from $ 69 to $ 499 . after chief executive @entity13 finished his presentation , journalists were given some hands - on time with the new devices . here are our first impressions : 7 - inch @entity20 and @entity10 there are a few new members of the @entity10 family , one at every popular tablet price point . there are two new 7 - inch devices , the $ 159 @entity10 and $ 199 @entity20 . @entity13 also announced a pair of higher - end , faster @entity20 devices , both 8.9 - inches , but they were not available for a demonstration . the @entity32 model costs $ 499 , the regular model $ 299 . the two 7 - inch @entity10 tablets look similar , but the hd has a few more features . available in @entity37 or @entity38 , the @entity20 has a higher resolution screen of 1280 - by - 800 pixels , @entity42 powered speakers , stronger @entity43 and better battery life . it also manages to weigh a smidgen less than the @entity10 . kindle hd vs. @entity47 : a comparison the exterior designs are slick and minimalist , similar to the new @entity50 , featuring a black body and no buttons . photos , videos and books all look great on the hd 's glossy screen and very nice on the @entity10 's screen . navigating on both devices is a snap . the operating system is a heavily reworked version of @entity62 , custom - made by @entity1 . an oft - repeated theme at the event was that @entity1 is focusing on the service , not the gadgets . it hopes to make money from its rich ecosystem of content , not the sales of hardware . the company makes no secret that the @entity10 is essentially a tool on which the company would like to sell you things , which is why the blatant attempts to point you toward new purchases do n't feel so much intrusive as , well , helpful . for example , turning the device into portrait mode makes room for custom suggestions . below the icon for an app is a selection of apps other customers also bought . same for a book or movie . if you 're looking at the thumbnail for a website , you 'll see other sites that are " trending now . " this soft sell is also present in the new x-ray feature for movies , which allows you to hit pause and automatically see @entity102 profiles for actors in the flick , finding out what else they 've appeared in . this list of other movies is great for settling arguments , and you can also click to buy them from @entity1 or add them to your watch list for future purchasing . crafty . @entity1 announces new wave of @entity115 one very interesting new feature just for the @entity10 is @entity117 , which allows you to listen to the audiobook version of a title , while the corresponding words are highlighted in the @entity4 version . this would be great for learning a language or for kids who are just learning how to read . an update to an older feature , @entity126 , combines the two versions , so you can switch between listening to and reading a book without losing your place . unfortunately , you will need to purchase both versions of the books individually to take advantage of the tools . speed still appears to be an issue on the the 7 - inch @entity20 . after tapping on an app or a photo , there 's a bit of lag time before you 're taken to your destination . it 's the same if you flip too quickly through a magazine or book . this came up on the @entity20 and the @entity10 across a variety of apps and media . it was n't noticeable while streaming videos , which played smoothly and looked crisp and seamless on both devices . the @entity10 and @entity20 will start shipping on september 14 , and the 8.9 - inch @entity157 will ship on november 20 . @entity158 it may not be the most expensive or feature - filled product announced thursday by @entity1 , but the @entity158 could be the most impressive complete package . one of the most persistent complaints about the @entity4 has been that it lacked a light . for people who were used to using smartphones in the dark , the @entity4 was a little too much like a real book . the @entity158 addresses that problem with what the company calls a " front - lit " display . the result is rather stunning . the effect is subtle , more of an all - over soft glow than a bright computer , tablet screen or a directional light . when you first look , you might not even notice it 's on , just that the text looks cleaner , crisper and easy on the eyes . the light is meant to be left on at all times , but the brightness should be adjusted depending on how much light you need . even in a bright environment , the light greatly improves how text displays on the screen . one of the @entity4 's biggest advantages over traditional tablets as an e-reading device is its impressive battery life . @entity1 claims that even with the new light on , the @entity158 will get up to eight weeks of battery life . the visual improvement extends to the touch screen , which has a higher resolution , 212 pixels per inch . and the background has been tweaked to be whiter , the text blacker . the @entity203 were on display in a brightly lit airplane hangar , so it was difficult to see how the light would look in a dark environment . the screen is the real star , but the outside has a few changes as well . there are no buttons anymore , and the body is black and thinner than the @entity216 . tapping the screen to advance to the next page could take a bit of getting used to for those of us accustomed to buttons on the sides of older kindles . there are some nice changes to the user interface that solve small problems . a time is now displayed at the bottom of the screen telling you how much reading time is left for a book . if you encounter a character in a book and ca n't remember who they are , the new x-ray feature pops up again to lend a hand . the tool will show you everywhere else the person 's name has appeared in the book , chapter or page . the improvements are n't drastic or flashy , but they are small changes that show a company paying attention to how its customers use the product and trying to perfect the user experience . the @entity158 costs $ 119 , or $ 179 if you opt for the 3g version . it ships on october 1 . kindle the biggest change for the bare - bones @entity4 e-reader is its price , which was dropped from $ 79 to $ 69 . the mono - tasking device is the cheapest in the @entity4 lineup , and it is the most similar to a paper book -- inexpensive , light , with an e-ink screen but no lighting . there are a few very minor changes to the ad - supported device . the body of the @entity4 is now black instead of gray , but the buttons and ports are all in the same locations . there are some new font options , and the company claims it has 15 % faster page turns . the new @entity4 is available to order now and starts shipping on september 14 .

the new @placeholder e-reader features a " front - lit " light that is subtle and stunning
