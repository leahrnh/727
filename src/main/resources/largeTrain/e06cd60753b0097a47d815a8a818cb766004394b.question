( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 never stops surprising us . every corner of the planet offers some sort of natural peculiarity with an explanation that makes us wish we 'd studied harder in junior high @entity1 science class . some of these sites are challenging to get to ; others are busy tourist destinations . they keep natural scientists searching for answers and the rest of us astounded by the secrets and mysteries the world continues to reveal . @entity20 , @entity21 most people wo n't see @entity20 in person , but even in photographs , the sight is arresting : a blood - red waterfall staining the snow - white face of @entity28 . the place was documented in 1911 by geographer / geologist @entity30 , a member of @entity33 's ill - fated expedition to the @entity21 . ( @entity33 named the glacier for @entity30 . ) 8 very old sites in the @entity36 since then , glaciologists and microbiologists have sought to determine what causes the mysterious red flow . they 've concluded that the source is a subterranean lake rich in the iron that gives the water its red hue . stranger still , recent research has revealed microorganisms living 1,300 feet beneath the ice , sustained by the iron and sulfur in the water . @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 what could possibly cause an automobile to roll backward uphill without power ? a magnetic force from within the @entity1 ? something even more fantastic ? since the 1930s , when the phenomenon of @entity51 was discovered ( and almost immediately promoted as a tourist attraction ) , people have been trying to figure out its riddle . even though it 's been demonstrated that the " magnetic force " is an optical illusion and the uphill slope is actually a downhill slope , that has n't stopped carloads of travelers from visiting @entity51 and testing it for themselves . digging deep : 15 ancient ruins you might not know @entity74 , @entity75 when people try to convince you there 's nothing new under the sun , direct them to the @entity75 island of @entity74 . before 1963 , it did n't exist . then , an underwater volcano in the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) erupted , and when the activity settled down in 1967 , what remained was an island where no island had been before . at its largest , @entity74 measured about 1 square mile , but wind and water have eroded the volcanic matter to a little more than half that size . presented with this unsullied environment , the @entity75 government determined that the best thing to do was preserve it . thus , although you can sail past it on a @entity84 day cruise , @entity74 remains off - limits to just about everyone except marine biologists , geologists , botanists and other scientists conducting research there . 8 elegant @entity110 mansion hotels @entity111 , @entity112 large spherical boulders -- some measuring 12 feet in circumference -- are scattered on @entity115 on the east coast of @entity112 's @entity117 . they formed millions of years ago on the ancient sea floor , collecting and hardening sediment and minerals around a core such as a fossil or a shell similar to the way oysters form pearls . they 're not the world 's only examples of what geologists call septarian concretions . you can also visit the @entity135 near @entity136 on the northwestern coast of @entity112 's @entity138 , for example . yet the @entity111 are some of the world 's largest . the particulars of their origin and what caused the distinctive cracks inside them are still being studied . midnight sun , @entity148 , @entity149 from april 20 to august 23 , the sun never sets over @entity151 , a @entity149 archipelago that lies north of @entity152 in the @entity153 . the phenomenon plays havoc with everyone 's body clocks . is it noon ? is it midnight ? after a day or two , it 's hard to tell . among the northernmost yet still - accessible places to experience the midnight sun is @entity148 , the largest island in the group . the island is well - suited and accommodating to travelers , who tend to keep strange hours in summer and who soon understand why their hotel rooms have been fitted with darkening curtains . @entity171 , @entity172 what appears to be a @entity175 - style snowy landscape in southwestern @entity172 is actually the result of calcium carbonate deposits from 17 natural hot springs accumulating over thousands of years . beginning in the late second century @entity181 , this area near present - day @entity180 was a destination for those who sought the therapeutic benefits of the mineral - rich water whose temperature reaches upward of 100 degrees @entity187 . today , you can see remnants of the baths at the ancient holy city of @entity192 , but it 's the stunning terraces , cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of @entity171 -- @entity172 for " @entity197 " -- that give it remarkable natural beauty . @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 how ordinary stones manage to " sail " over the surface of @entity200 in @entity201 is a mystery people have tried to solve since 1915 , when a prospector and his wife noticed tracks that seemed to indicate that the stones had somehow traveled across the dry earth . short of cosmic intervention , the stones required terrestrial forces to move them . but what forces ? the current prevailing theory about the " sailing stones " of @entity200 , presented by a team of physicists in 2011 , involves ice that forms around the stones , causing them to move and to leave a trail in their wake . many visitors still hope for a more mystical explanation . @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 behind the cascade of a small waterfall in the @entity232 section of @entity233 in suburban @entity234 , @entity227 , you might see what appears to be an optical illusion : a flickering golden flame . actually , you 'll smell it before you see it , and amazingly , it 's real , fueled by what geologists call a macroseep of natural gas from the @entity1 below . a geological fault in the shale allows about 1 kilogram of methane gas per day to escape to the surface , where , at some point , possibly the early 20th century , a visitor had the idea to set it alight . the water occasionally extinguishes the flame , but there 's always another hiker with a lighter to reignite it . @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 @entity259 claims the highest concentration of geysers of any place on @entity1 . geysers are hot springs with plumbing challenges that result in eruptions . more than 300 can be found throughout the park 's 3,472 square miles , and none is more famous than @entity258 . in fact , @entity258 is the reason @entity259 was designated a @entity201 -- the first in the @entity110 -- in 1872 . its name comes from the perceived regularity of its eruptions , which occur every 55 to 120 minutes and last for two to five minutes . the spectacular eruptions remain a source of fascination for the more than 3.5 million people who visit @entity259 each year . the fact that the eruptions are n't quite as regular as they might seem -- and that the mean eruption interval seems to be lengthening -- keeps geologists fascinated , too . @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 thanks to its humidity , its elevation and the clash of winds from the mountains and the sea , the southwestern corner of @entity288 in @entity286 has the world 's highest frequency of lightning activity ( 250 flashes per square kilometer per year ) . more than 200 nights per year , with peaks in may and october , lightning flashes fill the sky -- sometimes 25 or more flashes per minute . to put that in perspective : the @entity308 classifies anything over 12 strikes per minute as " excessive . " named for the @entity311 , which flows from @entity312 in to @entity288 , the @entity313 , or @entity314 , has become a highlight for travelers who spend their nights wide awake and wide - eyed watching the spectacle .
