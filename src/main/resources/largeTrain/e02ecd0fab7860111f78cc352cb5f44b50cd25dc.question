" their decision to join the military was motivated by a love for their brother and a desire to serve their country , " the priest told mourners friday . " the death of @entity39 touched him deeply . losing a brother and a friend made a profound impact on him , and brought to his attention the seasons of war and grief and loss . " @entity3 spoke to reporters thursday ahead of the funeral , struggling to find words to describe how much his youngest son meant to him and his family .

" we also had to remove as many of the men as we could out of that helicopter , " @entity13 remembered . " and i could n't participate in that . i knew my -- i knew @entity16 was in there . i tried several times to kind of gather myself , but i just -- i could n't . " @entity13 says as the men carried bodies out of the wreckage , he spotted his younger brother . " at one point they did carry @entity16 by me . and that 's when the reality , the complete reality , and complete understanding of the situation came to me and i began dealing with it .
