@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- you do n't expect to hear an electric saw in church , but @entity6 uses the tool along with a frying pan , blender and toaster oven to help free people from debt . @entity6 holds the boards steady as a woman uses a reciprocating saw to cut up her credit cards . this money missionary helps people destroy those little plastic shovels , otherwise known as credit cards , that so many people have used to dig their way to financial ruin . " it 's such an easy message . it really is , " says @entity6 , an ex-con who credits religion for his conversion from thief to money coach . " that 's why it does n't take a rocket scientist , it does n't take a @entity35 to do it . a first - year bookkeeper can figure out that you ca n't spend more than you make , " he said . earlier this month , @entity6 spoke to about 150 people at the @entity39 where @entity40 is the pastor . " you 've got to plan your spending ; you 've got to give back a part to @entity43 . you 've got to save for the future , and you 've got to learn to be content , " said @entity44 . @entity44 says the pressure of money and debt is enormous on people , especially more recently . " we should change the marriage vows from ' till death do us part ' to ' debt do us part ' because that 's what 's going on , and it 's so true , " he said . @entity6 is breathless . as he speaks to the crowd , he 's a non-stop , does n't - come - up - for - air , high - octane money missionary . he uses @entity62 principles , prayer , common sense , and a few good one - liners to get his message across . " i had a 401k , it went to a 201k , went to 101k , now it 's just @entity69 , " he said as the crowd laughs . " i 'm thinking i got a thousand bucks left , and i can retire for about a week . " @entity6 presides over a day - long sermon on how people can make their lives better by taking control of their spending . he says he tries to demonstrate the long - term effects of irresponsible borrowing . simple stuff , he says , will make people more content and give them the cushion necessary to give back . his new book is " @entity81 in 52 days . " " i want to get people to have more margin , so instead of investing in stuff , and stuff that does n't last , they can invest in people 's lives , " he said . the tools he uses to hammer home his message go beyond his overhead tv screens , charts and calculators . @entity6 invites his guests , who pay $ 25 a head to hear his message , to come up to the front of the room for what he calls the beginning of " freedom . " on a table , sit a frying pan , a toaster oven , a blender and a wooden sawhorse and an electric saw . about six people cut up their credit cards and bake them in the toaster oven as if they were tv dinners . others sliced and diced their @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , before mixing the pieces with @entity114 in the blender . at one point , @entity6 called for some cooking oil as one lady stood over her credit card - saute with a spatula . holding a plate full of the little pieces of credit card , @entity6 said , " this looks like a melted credit card , but this really represents freedom in these people 's lives , because it 's the first step . " @entity130 says she used to have 10 or 11 credit cards . she put on protective goggles , taped her cards to a two - by - four and shredded them with a reciprocating saw . " it just felt like the right thing to do to get me started on the right path , " she said . " @entity139 [ reciprocating saw ] was exhilarating . i love that feeling . " @entity6 was n't always this way . about 20 years ago , as a teen , he embezzled about $ 300,000 from the sheriff 's office in @entity146 , @entity1 . yes , the sheriff 's office . @entity6 was a bookkeeper and skimmed money from an account filled by payments from court judgments . he invested the stolen funds and profited about $ 50,000 before he was caught . he was charged with fraud and theft , and spent minimal time in jail . he paid half the money back . but , he says , that was another life ago . @entity6 says it took him four years to crawl out of his own hole ; he was $ 100,000 in debt . " i could spend a thousand dollars a day , " @entity6 told the crowd . " although , i 'd have to spend about two days recovering from that -- you know what i mean , " he said . " i completely sabotaged my life , all in one year . i did more damage in one year than most people do in their whole life . " one night , as a 20 year old , he says , he was parking cars at @entity39 's @entity172 . he was wearing black ladies garden shoes , because he could n't afford the black sneakers that were part of his uniform . a @entity177 pulled up , and inside was one of @entity39 's most recognizable newsmen , anchorman @entity179 . he took the car , turned on the radio , and heard a @entity62 financial expert say , " there is hope for the hopeless . all you have to do is give your heart and soul to the @entity189 . " " and then , i thought , oh lord , if you 're there . i need you . " " i was n't going to find satisfaction in money . the only place i was going to find it was outside of that , and i found it , in turning my heart over to @entity43 . " he became a @entity35 and spends one full day each week doing free financial counseling for needy people . he says he no longer gets high on money . he only helps people understand that they can manage their money in a way that can help themselves , their families and others . @entity207 and @entity208 were at the seminar . they said they ran up their credit cards and that their home , south of @entity39 , went into foreclosure last year . " @entity216 has been a very greedy , give - me - now country for so long , and i think it 's a wake - up call for everybody that we can live differently , " said @entity208 . @entity221 , her husband , says doing away with credit cards has helped them . the couple plans to be debt free in about 18 months . " they 're telling you : ' use me , you need me ' -- and they own you . we 've gotten to the point where we just do n't need credit cards , " he explained . " everything we do , we plan , and if we do n't have the money , we just do n't buy it , " he said .
