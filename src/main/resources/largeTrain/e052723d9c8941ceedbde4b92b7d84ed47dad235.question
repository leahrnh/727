@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a little - known provision of the @entity3 might provide a little - used way for president @entity5 to unilaterally get around stalled efforts to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts . it is a legal audible that was considered two years ago in a similar crisis , and ultimately rejected by @entity5 , a former constitutional scholar . in remarks on thursday , the president said the stakes were stark , if the debt ceiling were not raised , and the government unable to pay its bills . " as reckless as a government shutdown is , an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse , " he said , pointing the finger at @entity19 . congressional republicans who control the @entity26 insist they will not act until the administration commits to delaying implementation of key parts of the healthcare reform law , or to further spending cuts -- ultimatums the @entity26 rejects . the game of political chicken raises the potential of a recession and market meltdown if the @entity37 is not replenished by mid-month . some economists warn the debt ceiling impasse is a far greater threat than the ongoing government shutdown . that 's where @entity43 of the 14th @entity44 comes in : " the validity of the public debt of the @entity48 , authorized by law ... shall not be questioned . " does that mean the president could on own his raise the debt ceiling ? some congressional allies say yes . " it is an option that should seriously be considered , " said @entity55 chairman @entity54 of @entity56 . @entity26 minority leader @entity59 of @entity60 said it should have been done in 2011 , the last time the two branches went through this . back then it was former president @entity65 who led the rhetorical charge . he said he would have raised the debt ceiling " without hesitation " and " force the courts to stop me . " then - treasury secretary @entity71 also suggested such a legal right was possible , and plausible . but @entity5 was not sure . " i have talked to my lawyers , " he said at the time . " they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument , " suggesting he believed the courts would not accept such a move -- and more importantly , would the nation 's creditors . fast forward to 2013 . his spokesman monday repeated the @entity26 line @entity82 had the responsibility here . " the president ca n't raise it by himself , " said @entity26 spokesman @entity84 . " this administration does not believe that the 14th @entity44 gives the power to ignore the debt ceiling . and even if the president could ignore the debt ceiling , the fact that there is significant controversy around the president 's authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to @entity82 raising the debt ceiling , and would not be taken seriously by the global economy and markets . " legal and political scholars -- and the federal courts -- have debated just how relevant , and how far @entity43 was designed to go . the amendment was ratified in 1868 , to ensure in part , the unified nation 's debts from the just - ended @entity106 would be honored , and that @entity110 claims would not . the unquoted part of the provision specifically mentions the public debt " incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion . " the @entity48 @entity120 in 1935 -- in @entity121 v. @entity48 -- suggested @entity43 could be applied in other circumstances . " while this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government during the @entity106 , its language indicates broader connotation , " said chief justice @entity123 in the opinion , which concluded that voiding a @entity48 government debt was beyond the power of @entity82 . indeed other better - known parts of the 14th amendment -- the " due process , " " equal protection , " and " privileges or immunities " citizenship clauses -- have been cited in a sweeping range of litigation beyond its original reconstruction response to the rights of former slaves . those cases include abortion , segregation , even the 2000 @entity149 presidential ballot dispute . despite mr. @entity65 's bold challenge daring the courts to intervene , any unilateral action on the debt ceiling would be sure to prompt immediate lawsuits . whether an " aggrieved party " such as a taxpayer or bondholder , could establish legal " standing " -- allowing any legal action to proceed -- would be the first legal hurdle , a process that could drag on for months , even years before the @entity120 would be asked to offer the final word . but some politicians have said a default on the nation 's debt would constitute the kind of national emergency requiring of bold presidential action , something that would be politically acceptable to the public . legal challenges , they say , would wither if the economy rebounds . @entity5 urged negotiations to continue , but on thursday said the 2011 debt crisis hurt average @entity48 , and could do so again . " our economy took a bad hit . our country 's credit rating was downgraded for the first time , just like you would be downgraded if you did n't pay your mortgage . this time , they are threatening to actually force the @entity48 to default on its obligations for the very first time in history . " but some @entity187 say a constitutional crisis is overblown and so is concern of what will happen if both sides fail to agree in coming days . " i do n't think the credit of the @entity48 is going to be collapsed , " said rep. @entity192 ( @entity193 ) on @entity1 thursday . " i think that all this talk about a default has been a lot of demagoguery , a lot of false demagoguery . we have plenty of money coming in to service the debt . when we stop servicing the debt , that would be default . we 're a long , long ways from that . " so the dilemma here for the @entity26 would appear more political , less legal . in invoking executive power to raise the debt ceiling , @entity5 might earn quick political points , by claiming to put the nation 's financial health above congressional inaction . but the risks to a market and credit backlash , global investor unease , and softening public support -- not to mention an eventual @entity120 showdown -- might urge continued @entity26 caution . after all , the debt ceiling has been raised at least 74 times in the past half century -- 10 times in the past decade -- always through the typical back - and - forth political sparring between the @entity26 and @entity19 .

little known legal provision could again provide opening for president @placeholder on debt ceiling
