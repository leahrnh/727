@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 answers the door to his @entity0 home , a tall , slender figure in suede cowboy boots . @entity3 has left comic strips behind to focus on his writing -- particularly children 's books . but before he can extend a hand in greeting , he 's nudged aside by a canine companion eager to introduce herself . " @entity20 " offers a hearty welcome , vigorously shaking a tail that seems powerful enough to whack a lamp from an end table . the pit bull is one of a number of dogs that @entity25 and his wife , @entity26 , have rescued over the years . his affection and concern for dogs form the heart of " @entity32 : the @entity33 on @entity34 " ( @entity35 ) , @entity25 's new illustrated novel , whose hero is a resilient dachshund with a soup ladle for a leg . gallery : the art of @entity3 » it 's the latest children 's work from @entity25 , the @entity47 - winning cartoonist behind " @entity48 " and " @entity49 , " who 's had great success with the genre . the earlier " @entity55 ! " is set to be made into a movie produced by @entity54 . @entity25 invited @entity2 to his mountainside home for a rare interview , which touched on topics ranging from his book to @entity62 , @entity63 and his famous pen pal , @entity64 . watch @entity3 read from " @entity32 " » the following is an edited version of the conversation : @entity2 : the hero of your book is quite an unusual dog . @entity3 : @entity72 he 's called , by @entity73 [ the girl ] who finds him . ... the central part of the story is the fall of @entity78 from @entity73 's life and into the depths of horrors that dogs can sometimes experience in our world -- everything from being shot at , to research labs , to the worst dog shelters amongst the world of otherwise nice dog shelters , and he comes for revenge upon @entity91 [ a rival ] . and @entity91 is going to appear at the @entity34 coming up , so @entity78 has got to find a team of commandos to help him infiltrate and destroy the @entity34 . @entity2 : what was the inspiration for the story ? @entity25 : the book happened because i came across both a picture and a quote at about the same time -- a picture of one of @entity62 's fight dogs . it was set to be put down , but a shelter in @entity107 decided to take the dog and a few others at the same time and try to rehabilitate them . ... this was the first time the dog had ever received any affection in its life . ... it 's the most moving picture of a dog i 've ever seen , having gone through an impossible transition and fallen back to where dogs naturally go , which is just loving people . @entity2 : " flawed dogs " is put out by the " young readers " division of the publisher . @entity25 : i notice it 's getting a little bit of controversy in that people are coming to it assuming that it 's for the same audience that my picture books are for . and " @entity32 " the novel is definitely not . it 's perfect for an 8 - year - old , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , but i would n't read this in the evening to my 5 - year - old . and there is a difference . ... it 's revealed an issue that i 'm surprised about , which is the new preciousness that 's been brought to literature for children now . there is an abject fear of instilling any sort of dramatic trauma , of sadness , on the children who are receiving a story . ... and of course that was never a great concern in the past . the great children 's stories that we all grew up with , there are always moments of great tragedy and moving moments of loss in the book that we were n't afraid of -- as long as you bring them [ young readers ] back by the end and bring them to where a reader should be , a child should be . @entity2 : you do n't do a daily or a weekly comic strip anymore . how has that transition been ? @entity25 : if this was still 1985 and everything that means ... it would still be deeply appealing to be a cartoonist . but not now . i 'm happy to leave that behind . the level of political rancor -- powered and driven by web comment and cable news to a degree -- affects me like everybody else , and i get angry and i get annoyed and i get frustrated and that always translates into mediocre cartoons historically . ... i was getting too angry the last couple of years of cartooning , and it does n't do the art any good . i 'm very happy to let that go . @entity2 : when did you first discover , " wow , i can actually draw " ? @entity25 : i could never really draw something . it was , " wow , i can actually draw or write something that amuses somebody . " and that was a dawning that did n't happen until college . ... the greatest cartoonists ever have really been very mediocre artists . @entity63 was always quick to admit that his skills in artistry were limited at best . and in his case it served the strip perfectly . if " @entity213 " had been drawn with the artistry of " @entity210 " and a @entity212 animator , it would n't have worked . @entity2 : animals were an integral part of your comic strips . @entity25 : i knew that i wanted a strip with people but the focus on an animal , and an incongruous animal . ... so i looked around largely at an animal that had n't been done before in comic strips , an animal that is generally attractive to people and people feel immediately warm to and that just would be funny . you end up with a penguin pretty fast . plus , he 's already standing , and he 's kind of got clothes on . @entity2 : who are your heroes ? @entity25 : " @entity236 " was a huge influence on my work . @entity64 and i have over the years exchanged letters , which has been a massive delight . i can tell you that when i announced the end of my comic - stripping career and that @entity49 [ the penguin ] was not only going to fade away but fade away permanently , i got a letter from @entity64 urging me to reconsider letting @entity49 go away forever . i should have written back and said , " the moment you bring @entity244 back , i 'll bring @entity49 back . is that a deal , @entity64 ? " of all the people who should not be chastising me about stopping my career early , it would be @entity64 . @entity49 really is a bit like @entity244 in that he 's circulating around in his world , and he 's surrounded by a lot of insanity , a lot of hatred , a lot of intolerance and ... he 's the ultimate innocent at the center of it . and that 's how @entity244 worked in that story . i suppose i needed an @entity262 for @entity49 , but i never had time to develop one . ... i 'm not an artist who is trying to be a novelist . i 've always been a writer and the art was the way to sell the writing and it 's been convenient in that way . ... i 'd be happy to leave that all and just be a writer if i could get away with it . i do n't think i can at this point . they [ readers ] expect the pictures . i 'm happy to oblige .

after seeing picture , @placeholder says he wanted to do story about dog horrors , rescue
