( @entity0 ) -- for weeks , @entity1 hid from authorities , donning a disguise and using disposable cell phones to communicate . on tuesday , the 67 - year - old internet security pioneer emerged publicly in @entity7 's capital , hundreds of miles away from the @entity9 island in @entity10 where his next - door neighbor was found dead . @entity1 's lawyer said he left @entity10 to escape police persecution and planned to file a formal request for asylum with @entity7 officials wednesday . " he had to come here because it was the closest and the most immediate place to protect his life , " attorney @entity19 told @entity0 en @entity21 ol . @entity1 's arrival in @entity7 was the latest twist in an investigation that has drawn international attention and prompted the well known software company founder to go into hiding for weeks . @entity10 authorities have said they only want to talk to @entity1 about the november 11 shooting death of @entity31 , 52 , an @entity32 businessman who was found dead in his home on the @entity9 island of @entity35 . @entity1 , who is not a suspect in the case , lived next door . " i had nothing to do with his death , " @entity1 wrote on his website tuesday in a message to @entity31 's family . " i have lost five close family members in my 67 years and i know your suffering . " a @entity10 police spokesman said authorities there believe @entity1 could still be in their country , and they still want to question him in his neighbor 's killing . @entity1 , who founded the computer security software company that still bears his name , said in a blog post tuesday that he would speak to @entity10 police on the phone and offered to meet with the @entity61 nation 's prime minister " in a neutral country . " " if i am indeed merely wanted for questioning , " he wrote , " this should suffice . " a @entity7 official said late tuesday that officials there had not received a request for asylum from @entity1 and did not know how he came into the country . there is no registry of @entity1 entering legally at any official border crossing , said @entity74 , director of international bilateral relations for @entity7 's foreign ministry . " everything we know about this case comes from the media , " he said . the @entity7 official said he could not comment on whether his country would offer asylum to @entity1 , since no request had been filed . earlier tuesday , a @entity10 police spokesman said authorities thought @entity1 was still in that country , but declined to say why . " we 're not even sure he 's left @entity10 , " said @entity88 , spokesman for the @entity89 . " he said a lot of things . the police feel he 's still here in @entity10 . " it 's difficult to pinpoint what he will say next or what he will do next . i still question his frame of mind , " @entity88 said . " i think the best thing is for him to come in and answer a couple of questions . " @entity10 wo n't seek extradition of @entity1 , @entity88 said . authorities are n't unfairly persecuting @entity1 , and his attorney " should come to @entity10 and see what 's happening here , " @entity88 said . in an exclusive interview with @entity0 earlier this week , @entity1 said he fears authorities in @entity10 and said he 'd been afraid for his life ever since he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier . @entity88 said the interview showed @entity1 was trying to use media , especially international outlets , " as pawns in his game for sympathy . " " i think he really wants to make this into a great fiasco , " he said . " he 's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad , and we just believe he should , if he 's innocent as he 's saying he is , he should bring in his lawyer , and let 's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let 's move on , " @entity88 said . " i 'm sure he could be somebody who could direct the course of this investigation . " on his website , @entity1 said he has hired @entity19 " to assist in my fight against the government of @entity10 " and apologized for the secrecy surrounding his relocation . he did not provide details about how -- or when -- he arrived in @entity7 . " it was not easy to exit @entity10 and required many supporters in many countries , " he wrote . he said he planned to meet with @entity7 officials and hoped to speak to reporters in a news conference wednesday . @entity1 founded his namesake computer security software in 1987 , initially running it out of his home in @entity151 . he sold his stake in @entity153 in 1994 and moved to @entity10 in 2008 . the case began to unfold on november 9 , when @entity1 told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs . to put them out of their misery , he shot each in the head and buried them on his property , a former girlfriend said . officials say the dogs ' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between @entity1 and @entity31 , a contractor who retired to @entity10 from @entity174 and lived next door . @entity1 lived in the remote northern part of @entity35 . two days later , someone shot @entity31 in the head in his own living room . a 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor , and @entity31 was found dead on the second floor . @entity1 told @entity0 in the interview that he did not kill @entity185 and did not pay anybody to kill the man . he said he will not surrender to police for questioning , adding that his priority is to clear his name . three people have been detained for questioning in the killing , police have said , and investigators are pursuing multiple leads . a 2009 story in the @entity197 indicated that @entity1 's fortune had plunged to $ 4 million from its $ 100 million peak , largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments . in february 2010 , he started @entity205 , which says on its website to be trying to " reinvent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria . " journalist @entity210 and @entity0 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .
