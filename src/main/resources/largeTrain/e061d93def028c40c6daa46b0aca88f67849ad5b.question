@entity4 , @entity3 ( @entity2 ) @entity1 militants have attacked @entity5 in northern @entity6 , an effort that might be an earnest attempt to capture the key oil - rich city or perhaps to divert @entity11 troops fighting to capture the @entity14 extremist group 's stronghold of @entity15 . for months , @entity1 has been facing off with the @entity16 -- armed fighters who protect @entity6 @entity11 -- to the west of @entity5 . it had gone into areas on @entity5 's outskirts , but not the central city . until now , apparently . heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central @entity5 that local police had used as their headquarters . @entity16 and @entity11 anti-terror units later raided the hotel , wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them , according to @entity16 sources . in addition , two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the @entity11 forces out . also friday , @entity1 militants took over @entity36 , an area about 12 miles southwest of @entity5 , after heavy clashes with the @entity16 . among those killed was @entity40 . gen. @entity41 , the highest - ranking operational commander of the @entity16 brigade located in @entity5 . photos posted by @entity1 purportedly show the group 's militants in control of parts of south and southwest @entity5 , burning tents that had been used by @entity16 troops . the @entity51 military said friday that an @entity1 chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week . @entity55 worked in @entity57 's chemical weapons program before joining @entity58 in 2005 , @entity54 said . he was killed january 24 near @entity15 . " his death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ( @entity1 ' ) ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people , " the military said . there is no public evidence that @entity1 has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program . but @entity54 said : " his past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability . " @entity5 is a strategically important city in the months - long fight , one that has pitted @entity1 against the @entity16 , @entity6 government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group . it is one of the few notable cities -- apart from the region of @entity11 and its capital , @entity84 -- in northern @entity6 that have n't fallen to @entity1 . part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern @entity6 . the @entity11 and the central @entity6 government in @entity92 have long wrangled over control of those reserves , with each side wanting to keep hold of them . @entity1 , which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations , has been coveting them , too . @entity16 forces took over the @entity5 area in june when the @entity6 army crumbled in the face of @entity1 ' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from @entity1 since . in december , @entity1 claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20 . the attack , according to @entity1 , was meant to send a message to the @entity11 people and @entity16 fighters . still , @entity5 is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting -- which may be part of @entity1 ' rationale for friday 's attack there . the group has been fending off an offensive from @entity16 fighters around @entity15 , @entity6 's second - largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict , that has left the @entity128 extremist group on its heels . the city of 1.5 million people on the @entity132 has been held by @entity1 since june . @entity1 has invested heavily in governing the city . its leader , @entity134 , pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the @entity137 there in july . @entity11 officials say that as long as @entity1 holds @entity15 , it threatens @entity11 . likewise , neither the government in @entity92 nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy @entity6 's second - largest city . @entity16 forces have made steady progress against @entity1 north and west of @entity15 over the past two months . they have taken some 3,000 square kilometers ( 1,160 square miles ) of the @entity149 area , as well as the area around the @entity151 , choking off access routes and threatening @entity1 ' main resupply routes . there 's little doubt , though , that @entity1 remains a very real force , and threat , in much of @entity6 . the group , which calls itself the @entity159 , still controls a vast swath of that @entity162 nation and neighboring @entity163 . its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of @entity168 law , with its followers proving they will stop at nothing -- having been blamed for the large - scale killings of civilians , mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves -- during its quest . that violent campaign continued friday , and not just in @entity5 . dozens of gunmen believed to be from @entity1 faced off friday morning about 175 miles ( 285 kilometers ) away in central @entity184 , police and health officials in that city said . several hours later , that onslaught had been foiled and 20 gunmen were dead , according to the officials . elsewhere in @entity184 , a suicide car bomb explosion at an @entity6 army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others . violence flared in other parts of @entity6 as well that , while it has n't been tied to @entity1 , is further proof of the country 's unsettled state . six explosions went off friday around @entity92 , leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded , according to police officials . the deadliest such blast was in @entity200 , a busy commercial area in central @entity92 , leaving three dead and 10 hurt . @entity204 fades for @entity1 captives as deadline passes @entity2 's @entity207 reported from @entity4 and @entity208 from @entity209 , while @entity210 wrote from @entity211 . @entity2 's @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .
