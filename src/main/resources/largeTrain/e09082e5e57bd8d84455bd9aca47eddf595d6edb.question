( @entity0 ) -- let me tell you about the amazing kid who lives in our house . she 's 6 and she is the most hysterical , sarcastic , intelligent , funny , sweet , @entity8 , confident , strong , independent , considerate person i have ever met . i have no idea how she got to be this way . you see , my husband is a quadriplegic . i care for him , i work full - time , and there are days when i feel like our daughter gets very little of my attention . @entity19 was 6 months old when her dad was injured . during her first six months , he was just ok at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her . but he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together . then , our lives changed . it was december 21 , 2007 , three days before @entity19 's first @entity29 . at our annual @entity29 with our friends , around midnight , my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel . why ? because he 's @entity34 . i remember looking at him , smiling and shaking my head . he looked at me , grinned and ran out into the snow -- and never got up . he had broken his neck at the @entity41 / @entity40 level and was paralyzed completely from the shoulders down . i do not remember my daughter 's first @entity29 . my parents and sisters spent it with her while i was in the hospital with my husband . i went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying . i could n't even hold her because the responsibility of being a " single parent " in the physical sense was so overwhelming , i shut down . every single minute of the day , i begged someone to fix my husband . i remember one night in the @entity57 , the nurses got a rocker for me from the @entity59 and made me sit with @entity19 in @entity34 's room . it was like they knew we needed time together , just the two of us . it felt very foreign to me for a very long time . i felt like her babysitter , not her mom . while i rocked her , i stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much . my mom became @entity19 's surrogate parent for almost eight months because i needed to focus on my husband . she was the one who got up with our daughter when she cried , and brought her to visit in rehab . looking back , it still hurts to know how much time i missed with my daughter . i missed her first steps . i missed her first words . i missed so much . and it took years until i could let that all go , until i felt like her mom again . i 'm finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband . he was no longer able to hold her . to help her . to play with her . he had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child . as new parents , you expect things to be difficult . but when dealing with a spinal cord injury , difficult does n't begin to describe it . i went from caring for a 6 - month - old with my husband to caring for a 6 - month - old and my husband . i liked how things were before the injury . my strong , confident husband took charge and i followed . in a second , it changed . i had to be responsible for our family . i am always the first one up and the last one to bed . i am pushed to the limit physically , emotionally and mentally almost every single day . but it has made us stronger . as we learned how to live our " new " life , things became easier . we developed a routine . we found our sense of humor again . we worried about the relationship between @entity34 and @entity19 . a lot . every time she said that she did n't like him or want him around , we worried that it was because of his injury . we made a big deal out of it . we stressed about it . we talked to her teachers about it . we talked to a counselor about it . we thought that our daughter would n't connect with her dad because of his injury . it turns out we were wrong . very wrong . @entity19 is your typical 6 - year - old who just happens to have learned more about life than most ever do , one who will place her hands on my face and solemnly tell me , " everything will be ok . " our daughter loves her daddy . she knows he 's disabled . she knows he broke his neck . she knows there are limitations to what they can do together but trust me , they push the boundaries every single day . more than once , she 's come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk . she 's come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddy 's chair when she was climbing on it , or riding in his lap , or jumping onto the couch from his chair . too many times i 've had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house ; he in his chair and she on her scooter . too many times i 've had to tell them to stop it because they were about to get into trouble together . she 's figured out the best way to crawl into his lap to watch a movie . she climbs onto the counter so she can give him a kiss at night . she turns off his chair when he 's in her room at night so he has to stay while she falls asleep . she puts clips in his hair and puts makeup on him to play dress up . she rolls her eyes when @entity34 tells a terrible joke and thinks it 's hilarious when she tries to tickle him , even though he can not feel it . @entity19 does n't see @entity34 as a quadriplegic . she sees him as her father . she goes to him when she 's sad . she celebrates with him when she 's happy . his injury does not define their relationship . their love for each other does . every day i get to see that love they share grow into something even bigger . she has taught me how to look past her dad 's disability to see him for who he really is : my husband . the man i married . the man i love . that little kid has taught me more about love and life in her six years than anyone ever could . she taught us how to laugh again . how to have fun again . how to love each other again . she was the one who taught us that life was worth living . i can not wait to see else what else she can teach us as she grows .
