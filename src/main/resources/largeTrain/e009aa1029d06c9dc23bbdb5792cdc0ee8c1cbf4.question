( @entity0 ) -- as @entity2 looked down at her 2 - year - old son , @entity3 , lying unconscious in a hospital bed , she was mesmerized by how angelic he seemed . he was not bleeding . no cuts or bruises . he was perfect . you would not know that a tree limb had crushed his skull just hours earlier . that morning , @entity2 dropped @entity3 off at his day care in @entity11 , @entity12 . it was a relatively warm autumn day , and he was playing in the shade of a tree in front of the day care when a large branch fell on his head . see also : 10 common kid health emergencies and what to do @entity2 was working in @entity22 , less than an hour away , when she got a call from the day care , cribs to @entity26 , that @entity3 had an accident . " i did n't think much of it , " @entity2 recalled . she told her co-workers she would be back in a few hours . but as she was en route to the day care , she got another call that @entity3 was being transported to the hospital . " at that point i thought he had a broken arm or had a broken leg , " @entity33 reflected . when she finally reached the hospital , @entity38 , authorities were prepping @entity3 to be airlifted to @entity39 . @entity2 and her husband , @entity40 , drove more than an hour to @entity41 of @entity39 at @entity42 to meet @entity3 . there , doctors told the desperate couple that their son was going to need immediate brain surgery and braced them for the fact that he might not live through the operation . doctors removed parts of @entity3 's skull in order to operate on frontal and parietal lobes of his brain , areas that control thinking , personality and motor functions . but they found that parts of his brain were severely damaged by the blunt trauma , according to dr. @entity62 , a pediatric neurosurgeon who performed the first brain surgery on @entity3 when he came to @entity41 . despite the odds , @entity3 did not die . that warm autumn day , october 29 , would be the start of the @entity67 ' journey toward their son 's recovery , which would span months of medical complications , numerous surgeries and countless rehabilitation sessions . soon , @entity2 found herself living at @entity41 , watching over @entity74 , her favorite nickname for her son . she 'd watch his chest rise and fall as he remained in an induced coma for days on end . it was a stark difference from the daring 2 - year - old she had to keep an eye on a month before as he ventured up and down a water slide during a family cruise vacation . she felt helpless , but there was no one to blame . the police report cited the incident as an accident , and the tree with the branch that crushed @entity3 's skull was n't even on the day care 's property . she was at a loss , especially as she found herself explaining over and over on the phone to relatives and friends about what happened to her only child . desperate and in search of solace , @entity2 turned to @entity103 . she started posting news and sharing her thoughts on the page @entity107 , which was created to keep family members in the loop about @entity3 's health after the accident . she chronicled it all as she sat beside @entity3 's hospital bed : his daily vomiting , the restless nights , her bouts of fear . in between those posts , she shared photos of @entity3 before the accident . a magnetic smile stretches across the toddler 's face as he rides his red tricycle , poses proudly in his tiny suit and splashes in a pool . they 're chilling comparisons to the expressionless boy lying in a hospital bed . she did n't hold back details , but she tried to remain hopeful . " @entity3 had a pretty good evening . he threw up a few times , so we still ca n't find a pattern . so frustrating , but we are not giving up , " she wrote in one of her posts . blogging about @entity3 's progress became a form of therapy for her . " you have meltdowns and you have days where you cry and are depressed , but you get on there , and you see all these people who are supportive , " she said . " and all the stories people share of their kids getting poor prognoses from doctors that they are going to be vegetables , but then they pull through . those stories are really great . " over time , @entity2 's posts about her son 's accident and recovery found a mass audience . within a few months , the @entity103 page gained more than 700,000 followers . parents shared hopeful tales about their children persevering over ailments despite the greatest of odds . " it has been a blessing . it 's what keeps me sane , " @entity2 said . an @entity172 family 's race to help one of those people who found @entity3 's facebook page was @entity175 , who began following his journey in march . she did n't know @entity3 personally , but as the @entity178 resident stared at his small face on her laptop screen , she knew he was in pain . @entity3 's story reminded @entity175 of her own son . " i have a 2 - year - old boy who is blond and precious just like @entity3 's ' before ' photos , " she said . at the time , @entity2 was uploading photos of her son , unconscious and hooked up to all sorts of tubes after undergoing surgery to get rid of a bacterial infection that took root near his brain . it was an emotional step back after @entity3 was starting to make progress in rehabilitation . the juxtaposition between the images of @entity3 hooked up to colorful tubes and wires and the nostalgic photos of the carefree toddler before the accident stayed with @entity175 , even after she turned off her computer . a week went by , and the mother of two still could not get @entity3 's story out of her mind . " i was thinking this could be any of us , " said @entity175 , who as a child cared for a mother with multiple sclerosis . " i know what it 's like to be caring for someone who is sick and you ca n't do anything about it . " so she began brainstorming ways to help . she turned to her husband , @entity220 , the owner of three bike shops in @entity178 and a seven - time @entity172 triathlete . @entity175 asked him how long it would take to ride his bike from @entity225 , @entity178 , to @entity39 . she reasoned that they could do something to raise money for @entity3 and his family . " they were n't asking for donations , but my heart connected to @entity3 's anguish , " she said . " i did n't have a lot of money of my own that my family could spare , but i knew ( we could ) raise money for them . " the couple decided to make the bike - riding fundraiser a reality for @entity3 and his family . they set a date , june 26 , when @entity245 would begin riding his bike nearly 900 miles from @entity178 to @entity39 over five days . when @entity175 contacted the @entity67 about the plan , they were slightly stunned by the idea . " we got the e-mail from @entity175 about what they wanted to do -- her husband riding 900 miles -- we were like , ' wow , that 's kind of crazy , ' " @entity249 recalled . @entity245 agrees that 900 miles is a hefty distance . " i 've ridden my bike pretty far but never the distance that i am going to do for this trip , " he explained . he says doing it for someone else makes the goal seem possible . " you are motivated when doing an @entity172 , but it is for yourself . in this case , it is for @entity3 and for his family , " he said . as her husband trained for the ride , @entity175 worked on building momentum for the cycling event . she started a fundraiser called @entity272 to give @entity273 and received donations from people online . in hopes of reaching a wider audience , she sent in a @entity278 about @entity220 's bike ride on march 16 . the story now has nearly 60,000 views , and they 've collected more than $ 105,000 . all she wants , @entity175 explained , is to raise enough money so that @entity2 can continue being by @entity3 's side . a @entity3 that changes lives now that @entity3 is back home after spending more than five months in the hospital , @entity2 -- who has n't gone back to work since the accident -- spends most of her time caring for him and writing about the baby steps @entity3 is making in his recovery . months ago , he could n't speak , but now he is starting to moan , she reported . " and when you say , ' @entity3 , look at @entity294 , ' he looks at you after a 20 - second delay , " @entity2 said . it 's progress , considering there was a time when @entity3 's eyes could n't focus . he has limited mobility and has to be pushed around in a little wheelchair . " but in rehab , he will move his toes when you tell him to lift his legs , " she said . " you can tell he is really trying . " at the end of the day , @entity3 's parents say , who he is now and who he was before are simply not comparable . they want what any parent in their situation wants : for their son to ultimately make a full recovery and live a normal life . but right now , just scrunching his nose or wiggling his toes is considered a big success . deaf toddler hears first words although she still blogs regularly about @entity3 , @entity2 is no longer spending every moment at his bedside . the couple goes on walks with @entity3 in his wheelchair , attends charity events for their son and have guests over for play dates . it 's all a part of putting their life back together and sharing those stories with the followers and friends they have found online . friends like @entity175 , whose charity for @entity3 transformed her from a stay - at - home mom to a philanthropist . " working on this charity , i feel like i found myself and i feel like i am making a positive change , " she said . as @entity245 's ride to @entity39 draws near , she hopes other people will also follow the story of @entity3 , his family and the work everyone has put into seeing this bike ride happen . " it 's more than just a story about a little boy . it 's also a story of strangers helping strangers , " she said .

on october 29 , 2 - year - old @placeholder was severely injured at his day care in @entity12
