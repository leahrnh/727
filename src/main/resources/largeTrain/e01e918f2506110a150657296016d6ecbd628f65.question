( @entity0 ) -- it 's the midst of peak cruising season , and millions of travelers are eagerly embarking on exotic vacations without thinking they could ever fall victim to a crime at sea . @entity10 ' queen mary 2 sails into @entity11 . @entity12 says it has kits to aid rape investigations aboard . but sexual and physical assaults were the leading crimes committed onboard cruise ships in recent years , the @entity16 says . in march , a 42 - year - old female passenger aboard the @entity21 says a @entity23 crew member sexually assaulted her during a cruise , according to an @entity16 affidavit . the woman met the 38 - year - old crew member for drinks in a dining room on the cruise ship operated by @entity31 , which did not respond to @entity0 's request for comment . the friendly encounter turned terrifying , the woman told the @entity16 , after her assailant blocked the doors to the room , trapping her inside , and forced her to perform oral sex . " travelers have this idea they are in a special cocoon where nothing bad can happen , " says @entity40 , a leading maritime lawyer in @entity41 , @entity42 , who is representing the alleged victim from the @entity21 and has handled more than a hundred cruise assault cases in the last decade . " that 's just not true . " addressing cruise ship violence has become an important issue for lawmakers as the $ 22 billion cruise industry proliferates . about 12 million @entity54 will set sail on a cruise this year , according to the @entity57 , a trade organization representing the industry . @entity60 crimes have made headlines in recent years , like the @entity62 newlywed who vanished from his @entity65 honeymoon cruise in 2005 . last tuesday , the @entity66 began searching for a passenger who went missing on a @entity69 cruise ship . though cruise companies do n't display crime statistics to the public , they are required to report serious incidents involving @entity75 to the @entity16 and @entity66 . @entity76 , deputy assistant director at the @entity16 in 2007 , told lawmakers that the @entity16 opened 184 cases on crimes that occurred aboard cruise ships between 2002 and early 2007 . the cruise industry points out that those numbers are small when compared with the number of passengers served by the industry -- about 64 million in that same five - year period . sen. @entity87 of @entity88 and rep. @entity89 of @entity90 have introduced the 2009 @entity91 , which requires the cruise industry to publicly report crimes and improve safety on board . it mandates peepholes and security latches in cabins . this week , several victims of cruise crimes will meet with senators to discuss the issue . the cruise industry says that it is " working closely " with lawmakers on the bill and that passenger safety is a top priority . @entity65 , the second - largest cruise vacation company , has closed - circuit television cameras in hundreds of public locations on its ships , according to the company 's web site . @entity12 , which operates luxury cruises , would n't share security details with @entity0 but said its ships carry kits that investigators need to gather evidence of rape . the number of attacks on ships is probably higher than reported , sexual assault experts say , because rape victims are afraid to come forward on an isolated ship with perpetrators in close quarters . they also say cruise travelers are at a higher risk for attack because of readily available alcohol and a partying mentality on the vessels , which haul an average of 2,000 passengers each from across the globe . of the attacks investigated by the @entity16 , a majority involved the use of alcohol . cruise lines disagree , saying people are safer on the ships than they are in their own communities . the companies provide 24 - hour security and screen passengers ' belongings . " the cruise ship is a closed community , " said @entity151 , executive vice president of the @entity57 . security officers " have absolute access to everyone onboard , " he said , because each person has been documented before boarding the ship . authorities say passengers should report crimes immediately to a cruise line security officer or staff member on board . there are no @entity75 - mandated " cruise police , " nor are @entity16 agents assigned to cruise ships . " it 's unclear what you should do when you 're on a ship , " says @entity169 , vice president of policy at the @entity171 . " 1 - 800 numbers do n't always work when you 're at sea . " some attorneys say the security and medical authorities aboard the ships may be biased in their investigations . " the cruise workers are paid by the cruise lines . do you honestly think the cruise ship doctor will be favorable toward the victim ? " says @entity186 , a maritime attorney in @entity187 , @entity90 . vessels need independent , third - party security officers and cruise doctors , critics say . they point out that even the airline industry has federal air marshals on planes with international itineraries . attorneys for the victims also point out that @entity16 statistics on cruise crime show that in nearly half of the incidents , a crew member is the suspect , which may deter victims from coming forward because they do n't know which employees to trust . the @entity57 says on its web site that the industry 's work force is prescreened by the @entity212 , which is responsible for issuing work visas to foreigners working on ships that stop in @entity75 ports . many passengers are unaware that being on a cruise ship is equivalent to being in a foreign country . vessels are typically foreign - flagged from countries like @entity222 and @entity223 . cruise lines are n't obligated to follow the crime investigation and reporting guidelines that law enforcement would follow on @entity75 soil , attorneys say . filing lawsuits can also be difficult when the crime occurs in foreign waters because the trials can sometimes take place in courts abroad . " they [ cruise lines ] will commit to nothing , " says @entity236 , president of @entity237 , a nonprofit group . " they will sell you the tickets , " he says , " and then fail to take responsibility . " @entity236 's daughter disappeared on a celebrity cruise ship in 2004 . he filed a lawsuit in 2005 accusing the cruise company of hiding information about her disappearance . the suit was settled a year later . some attorneys question the training of private cruise ship security officers . @entity257 , 38 , testified before @entity258 that she was raped aboard a @entity65 ship three years ago . she said cruise staff instructed her to gather evidence , so she and a friend went to the cabin where the assault occurred and piled her clothes and bed sheets into plastic bags they were given . " we did n't know what we were doing , " says @entity257 . she said she was later told by authorities there was n't enough evidence to prosecute a criminal case . " it makes me frustrated looking back that the cruise lines did n't handle evidence properly . " @entity257 's suit against @entity65 was settled in early 2008 . she says she ca n't disclose the amount . cruise industry officials say their security officers are trained in how to preserve evidence . @entity69 , the largest cruise company in the world , says its security personnel must have previous security , military or law enforcement experience . even if evidence is gathered properly by cruise security , the time that elapses between the crime and @entity16 involvement may threaten the integrity of an investigation . in the @entity21 case in march , three days passed before the ship docked in @entity90 and @entity16 agents could step aboard . that incident , however , was handled in exemplary fashion , say attorneys and even some cruise line critics . the evidence was sufficient enough for the @entity75 district attorney 's office in the @entity304 of @entity90 to charge the alleged offender , @entity305 , with aggravated sexual abuse . @entity305 is pleading not guilty to the federal offense , which carries a possible life sentence . @entity305 says the encounter was consensual , according to his attorney . @entity311 , a spokesman for the @entity75 district attorney 's office prosecuting @entity305 , said charging offenders with cruise - related crimes can also be complicated by challenges such as tracking key witnesses abroad . the biggest threat , though , is the time lag , when valuable evidence can disappear or be tampered with , he said . " when we can bring the case , we 'll bring the case , " he said . " @entity305 is a good example . "

in a five - year period , the @placeholder opened 184 criminal cases aboard cruise ships
