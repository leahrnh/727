@entity2 ( @entity3 ) the day before @entity1 came out as the original voice of @entity5 in the @entity6 , she lost her @entity7 . @entity8 . but that 's just one smile - inducing twist in a less - than - two - week journey that 's left this suburban @entity2 voiceover actor " gobsmacked " and feeling like " some strange tropical bird " on display , she said . " i had no idea this would be such a big deal . " on october 4 , exactly two years after @entity22 's virtual " assistant " was introduced to the masses with the release of the @entity20 , @entity3 revealed her identity . hours after our in - depth story was published online , she was sitting on the @entity27 set of @entity3 's " @entity28 " morning show . and a new day it was for @entity31 , who -- without her phone -- had no idea how much her world was about to change . at her airport gate to head home from @entity27 , she got a sense . a man who kept staring at her finally approached with a question : " are you that @entity5 person ? " coming forward , in itself , had been cathartic . she 'd grappled with the idea , mostly at the urging of her son , ever since she was surprised to find out she was the voice behind @entity5 . the recordings used for the @entity5 voice had been laid down by @entity31 in 2005 , long before anyone outside of @entity22 knew that something called an @entity7 was even on the horizon . " i ca n't tell you how freeing it was to make that decision , " she said . " i 'd been torturing myself for two years . " after a whirlwind 10 days of travel and newfound exposure , @entity31 sat down over coffee and talked about what her life has been like since she took the leap from anonymity . the media frenzy to say that she got slammed with media requests would be an understatement . by the time @entity31 got back to @entity2 from her morning tv appearance on @entity3 's " @entity28 , " between 400 and 500 e-mails were waiting for her . most of them were requests for interviews . meanwhile , her husband , @entity77 , sat at home fielding phone calls as they poured in and asking , through the front door , for a local tv crew to leave . " i thought i might get a couple e-mails . maybe the ( @entity83 ) would want to do a little story , " @entity31 said . " this is craziness . " 15 of @entity5 's best ( and worst ) jokes the requests have been global , coming from places as far - flung as the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 . she stared at what was in front of her , knowing she was in over her head . she had no idea where to begin . fortunately , a hot - shot publicist in @entity100 , @entity101 of @entity102 , was prepared to take over . @entity31 would quickly go on to read a top 10 list for @entity104 and make appearances on " @entity106 " and @entity108 's " @entity107 . " she 's done interviews with a handful of media outlets , including @entity113 and the @entity114 , and hit the radio morning show circuit : 18 programs in three hours alone . a new stable of handlers the publicist is just one person helping @entity31 navigate her new normal . she 's also landed @entity120 of @entity121 , one of the top voiceover agents in the nation and someone she hopes will help her reach her ultimate dream : to voice a cartoon character . @entity31 does n't want to discuss details but said after last week , that dream finally feels possible . and then there 's her son , @entity31 , a photographer in @entity100 . on a four - day trip @entity31 recently took to @entity134 , her son played chauffeur , schlepping his sleep - deprived mother from meeting to meeting . he also has stepped in to manage his mom 's growing social media presence , something she 'd never focused on before . and that 's how her new @entity142 handle , @ @entity143 , was born . finding comfort in the spotlight when asked to appear on @entity3 's " @entity28 , " @entity31 was at first reticent . years earlier , she 'd done on - camera work , mostly for corporate videos . but in a world where appearance -- and , by association , age -- matters , she found herself being phased out . as a voiceover actor , she does n't have to worry about looks and can wear what she wants . there 's tremendous comfort in that . so the decision to step in front of live cameras was n't immediate for her . but she then realized that coming out as the voice of @entity5 had been the big hurdle . that was the scary part . once she did walk onto the set of " @entity28 , " she was surprised by how comfortable she was . " all of a sudden , that old memory of how to behave on camera came out , " said @entity31 , who declines to give her age . " i was n't nervous at all . " the caked - on makeup , though , she can do without . by the time she got back from her @entity134 jaunt , she said , her skin -- what with all the makeup , the drier air , the lack of sleep -- felt like it had aged 10 years . she got home and said all she wanted to do was face - plant into a tub of moisturizer . well , that and sleep . over four days in @entity134 , this night owl thinks she got no more than 18 hours of sleep . " i felt really proud of myself that i was able to do everything i was asked to do , " she said . " it was exciting but also exhausting . " unexpected -- and moving -- messages in the past 10 days , @entity31 has heard from old friends , people she has n't been in touch with for decades . and while most close family members were privy to her @entity5 secret , some distant relatives were not , which has meant some reconnecting that way , too . strangers have written , begging her to record their outgoing messages for them . and wannabe voiceover actors seeking advice have reached out to @entity31 , who 's trying to make a point to answer each and every e-mail -- which at last count numbered more than 600 . but the most moving responses have come from members of the blind community . @entity31 has long been a voice of many @entity217 , or text - to - speech , services , beyond the technology used to create @entity5 . for the first time , she 's received thank - you notes from people she 's served , people who 've relied on her but did n't know her name until now . their common message : " thanks for enabling us to do all we do , " she said . one writer specified that she 'd helped him work his computer , use his phone and " read " textbooks . realizing the tangible difference her voice has made in other people 's lives made her cry . " this can be a thankless business , " she said . " it 's so nice to know my voice is being used in a good way . " what 's next @entity31 feels blessed to love what she does in @entity2 . she came home to her loving guitarist husband , her kitties , the lush trees and her quiet home . she 's back with her community of colleagues , musicians and friends she could n't appreciate more . between resting her voice from all the recent attention , she 's getting back to work -- serving the same clients , recording in her home booth , laughing with the engineers who feel like family . she does n't expect this flood of attention to last forever . she suspects that most of her " 15 minutes of fame " already came and went . if she continues doing what she does , she says , she 'll be fine . but she 's open and excited to see what might happen next . " life is change , " she said . " it 's inevitable . " there 's talk of a book deal and a speaking tour , two ideas that make her shake her head in amused disbelief . she 's already been asked to give a keynote address at a big telecommunications conference next year . and if other new jobs come out of this experience -- like a cartoon offer , perhaps -- she would , of course , be thrilled . " i 'm grateful for all of it , " she said . " it 's absolutely surreal . " but , @entity31 insisted , none of this has changed or will change who she is . she looked down at her new @entity291 , the one she ca n't seem to figure out -- " why ca n't i get e-mail ? " -- and headed back to real life .

on october 4 , @entity3 revealed @entity1 as the original @entity6 voice of @entity5 on the @placeholder
