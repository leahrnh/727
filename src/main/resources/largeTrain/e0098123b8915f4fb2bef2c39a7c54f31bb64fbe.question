( @entity0 ) -- at an auction at a gallery in @entity5 recently , a piece of artwork sold for a higher price than had been anticipated by the auctioneers : $ 4,080 . it was n't a very big piece of art -- just 8 - by - 10 inches . technically , it was n't even art. it was a glossy black - and - white photograph . it had a slight imperfection : there were staple holes in the upper left - hand corner . someone had written all over the front of the photograph . the person who had scrawled on it was , in fact , the subject of the photograph . he had written : " to @entity27 , with very best wishes , @entity26 " that is what made the photo so valuable to someone : @entity26 had held it in his hands , had run his pen over it . the owners of @entity38 , where the signed photo was auctioned , believe that @entity26 had autographed the picture in 1956 , when he was a @entity41 senator . the picture itself was n't worth much ; but his signature , personalized to @entity27 . ... " as far as we know , she was n't anyone famous , " @entity45 , a @entity38 employee , told me on the day after the auction . " there 's no particular significance to her name . " then why would someone pay more than $ 4,000 for the photo ? @entity45 told me that the identities of the buyers and sellers at @entity60 auctions are kept confidential , so she could not disclose who had consigned the photo for sale , or who had purchased it . but she said there is a pretty safe rule of thumb about the sale of autographs of renowned men and women : " what people are buying is the mystique . they are taking home the autograph knowing that this person once actually touched this item , this person once actually left this imprint , this signature . " she clearly knows what she is talking about ; just this weekend , it was announced that another auctioneer had sold what is purported to be perhaps the last autograph @entity26 ever signed : a copy of the @entity89 that he reportedly signed for a woman upon his arrival in that city on november 22 , 1963 . a man in @entity94 purchased it for $ 39,000 . in our digital age , in which images and data are transferred from person to person with the tap of a key , it would seem to be an anachronism : the idea of placing enormous monetary value on pieces of paper upon which prominent individuals once wrote their names . but that personal touch seems to have remained precious ; @entity45 said that many , if not most , purchasers of autographed items display them as if they were rare paintings : framed and mounted in places of honor . she did n't have to convince me . i have only two pieces of art hanging in my home , and neither would qualify as art in the conventional sense . but i would n't trade them for @entity127 or @entity128 . the first is an original theater lobby poster for the greatest movie about newspapers ever made : 1952 's " deadline -- @entity41 " , starring @entity133 . the other piece of art is an autograph -- actually , an entire ( if brief ) handwritten letter . it is a thank - you note . a thank - you note written to a laundry . at the top of the piece of paper , embossed in the italics / script font style of 1950s suburban - housewife stationery , are the words : " from the home of ... @entity149 " and beneath it , in blue ballpoint pen : " i should like to commend your laundry for doing a fantastic job on my clothes , you show esceptional care . @entity157 " that 's just how , while living in a house on @entity161 in @entity162 , in the years before he moved to @entity163 , he wrote it . " laundry " capitalized in the middle of the sentence ; a comma instead of a period after " clothes " ; " esceptional " instead of " exceptional . " i ca n't imagine a more wonderful or telling artifact from @entity149 's life . who writes thank - you notes to their laundries ? the young @entity149 , that 's who . there 's such an essential sweetness to it -- to the very fact of the letter , to the formality of his introduction ( " i should like to commend ... " ) , to the adjective he chose ( " a fantastic job on my clothes " ) . i purchased the letter from a gallery two decades ago ( for a price that made me bite the inside of my mouth ) , and i would rather own it than the @entity192 . i was about to say that i would never part with it , but in fact i once did , for several months . an exhibit called " @entity196 : treasures from the @entity201 " was touring the country , and was scheduled to make a long stop at the @entity199 of the @entity199 . included in the exhibit were the original @entity202 , @entity203 's 1879 patent application for the electric lamp and the instrument of surrender of the @entity207 during @entity208 i thought @entity149 belonged there , and persuaded the curators of the museum to accept his thank - you letter on loan . the @entity201 said they would not object , so long as @entity149 ' note was not in the same room with the more austere documents . it worked out fine ; i thought @entity149 would like it that way . he always was proud to be an outsider . in the hallway adjacent to the entrance to the main exhibit -- visitors saw it right as they walked in -- was @entity149 ' handwritten letter , in a display case , with a plaque that read : " this note , written by @entity149 when he was on the verge of becoming a star , provides an example of how seemingly trivial documents can increase in value and cultural significance as a result of historic events . it also shows that despite his growing fame in the early 1950s , @entity149 cared about the feelings of others . " brings a tear to your eye , does n't it ? i can fully understand why someone in @entity5 the other day would purchase the photograph that @entity26 once signed for @entity27 , whoever she may have been . you do n't have to be @entity27 to comprehend the value of that picture , just as you do n't have to be @entity149 ' laundry to comprehend the value of that thank - you note . great art , like great beauty , is where you find it . it is , as they say , in the eye -- or the laundry bag -- of the beholder . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .
