the previous night we 'd been turned away by stern - looking border guards . a categorical " no entry " to @entity3 . trans - where ? @entity3 is a breakaway state , recognized by no sovereign nation . it 's a sliver of land sandwiched between @entity7 and @entity8 and only a little larger than @entity9 , the smallest state in the @entity10 . " you ca n't come in . right now there is no permission for foreigners and no permission for journalists , " said the @entity3 border guard , clad in an oversized peaked cap with @entity15 - style hat - badge . it was past midnight and we were too tired to argue . to be honest , we had expected as much . a week earlier , @entity3 authorities had fast - tracked our request for a journalist visa to report inside their territory . instead of waiting the normal 10 days ' processing time , officials had responded within 36 hours . it was a speedy " no. " @entity3 split from the former @entity15 republic of @entity7 following a two - year war ( 1990 - 1992 ) that erupted as the @entity15 collapsed . the @entity33 stepped in to back @entity3 -- located on the right bank of the @entity35 -- but never recognized it as an independent state . it became a land in limbo . more than a decade later , and after @entity33 troops marched into @entity8 's @entity43 , @entity41 's top military commander gen. @entity40 warned @entity44 may be eyeing other targets . western intelligence has shown tens of thousands more @entity33 troops massed on @entity8 's eastern border . ' frozen conflict ' @entity40 suggested the force -- backed by tanks and attack helicopters -- was large enough to roll right through @entity8 from east to west and into @entity3 . the general described this as one of @entity33 's " frozen conflicts " -- an unresolved political and territorial dispute -- which @entity44 could reignite at any time in a bid to expand its influence across the region . like the generals in @entity44 and @entity63 , we pored over our map , tracking backroads and alternate routes into the self - declared country . we decided to try to visit as tourists ; our target was the " @entity73 " a top nightclub in the @entity3 border town of @entity72 . attempting our approach this time from @entity7 , we sloshed a half bottle of local brandy on the floor of our minivan to give it a party smell . maybe they got bored of our incoherent fast - talk or perhaps bought the idea that @entity3 nightlife was a big draw for international partygoers . after a long wait , we were waved through . as we rolled past decaying heavy industry and tumbledown @entity15 - era apartment blocks , it was clear @entity3 needed more than a fancy nightclub to give it a touch of glamor . at the doors of the " @entity73 " , we were informed that the night 's planned event was body painting and a contest to win free cocktails . the rules did not seem entirely clear . we headed instead for an early night in the capital @entity99 . my last foray into cocktail drinking in former @entity15 states had ended badly . a week earlier , up on the @entity8 's northeast frontier with @entity33 , a @entity8 tank commander had cracked open a jar of pickled tomatoes , offered up some raw eggs and uncorked home - made vodka . when the fruit vodka ran out -- we ended the chilly night , in a foxhole , drinking shots of a cloudy liquid from a plastic bottle . before he passed out , the gunner explained it was the cleaning fluid for the tank 's electronics . no desire to repeat that in @entity3 . trapped in time as we headed early sunday into downtown @entity99 , it was easy to see @entity3 is a place trapped in time . the hammer and sickle is still proudly emblazoned on the @entity3 flag . a @entity15 star is perched atop the city council building and a few blocks down , a towering statue of @entity133 rises like a guardian angel . the roads are named after revolutionary icons : @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity133 . there 's also just plain " communist street . " at a flea market , old men traded @entity15 army cap badges and shoulder flashes . many here still hanker after the glory days of the @entity147 . " of course it was good with the @entity15 . we wanted to be with @entity33 and still want to be with @entity33 , " one elderly lady told me . she wrapped her arms around herself as she explained how she had felt protected by the old @entity15 @entity153 , one of the men selling old @entity15 military mementos added : " it was good in those days but we know we can not turn back time . but we want to join @entity33 now and set up a free - trade zone . " " we do n't want to be part of @entity7 . they only grab money for their own pockets , " he added . pro-russian talking to people here , it 's hard to fathom why @entity41 chiefs would warn of an impending @entity33 invasion of @entity3 . the doors seem to be wide open and the welcome mat is out . " let them come . here people are all for it . if the @entity33 military comes everybody will shout ' hooray , ' " a chatty blonde woman said . transnistrians have repeatedly called to be allowed to join the @entity33 . @entity44 has so far failed to recognize @entity3 's independence -- insisting that it should first resolve its dispute with @entity7 . after its annexation of @entity43 , some political and military analysts believe @entity33 may be readying to redraw some of @entity182 's borders without further consultation . away from the flea market , stands " @entity185 , " an @entity187 - style pavement caf√© that serves only instant coffee and dozens of varieties of sugary cakes . law student @entity191 and boyfriend @entity192 , an it student , were consumed in a very public show of affection . their minds were more focused on love not war . but they paused briefly for questions . " if the @entity33 come in it would n't be a tragedy at all . the @entity33 military is already here , " @entity192 said . the couple added that they intended to go to @entity33 once they 'd graduated to look for well - paid work there . they said good jobs were hard to find in @entity3 . when the @entity15 star waned , a new star rose over @entity3 -- that of @entity214 economics . an ex-kgb agent and former president appears to be one of the biggest businessmen in town . he goes under the brand name " sheriff " and has a chain of supermarkets , gas stations and even @entity99 's top soccer club . other businesses here may not be so mainstream . international economists often describe @entity3 as a state whose fortunes are built on smuggling booze and tobacco and selling old @entity15 weapons . out in the countryside , @entity234 has no head for shady dealings . i find her hoeing weeds from her small vineyard . she says her land is perfect for growing organic grapes . some of it goes to produce @entity244 -- a @entity3 cognac . she believes becoming part of @entity33 would bring greater economic benefits like cheaper energy , especially @entity33 natural gas for heating her home and powering local industry . she 's also heard @entity33 pensions are four times higher than in @entity3 . " why do we need @entity182 ? it 's good for us to be part of @entity33 . maybe @entity182 is ok for the young people , " she said . @entity33 soldiers never left @entity3 , after its 1990 - 1992 independence war with @entity7 . a contingent of around 1,200 occupies bases and highway checkpoints here -- another indication @entity33 president @entity263 would not need to invade since his troops are already here . on the outskirts of the capital , we venture into another @entity15 - era apartment complex . on a wall , there 's a starkly poetic line of graffiti scrawled in @entity273 . it could be the lament of star - crossed lovers or perhaps a sign of the political times . " i love you . but why i love you ? ... i never know . " a message from @entity3 . to @entity33 with love .
