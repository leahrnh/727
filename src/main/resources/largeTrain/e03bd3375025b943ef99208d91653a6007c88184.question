( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 first appeared on " the @entity2 " 44 years ago . it 's also been 44 years since the @entity1 held the five top positions of the @entity7 pop chart , a feat never achieved before -- or since . @entity8 wishes peace and love to everyone following @entity12 singing " @entity13 " to him . but no time has passed since one of the @entity1 , @entity8 , was playing up on stage . the drummer 's 68th birthday monday coincided with his 10th " @entity8 and his @entity20 " tour . in honor of the day , he asked people to take a moment at noon for peace and love . thousands joined him in @entity26 to do just that . he also celebrated his birthday on " @entity29 , " talking with @entity12 about @entity30 , his new album and the tour . the following is an edited version of the interview : king : how did you come up with the idea [ of peace and love ] ? @entity8 : oh it came in a dream -- flaming pie . it 's just -- i just thought it would be a nice thing when , you know , because it 's my birthday and i 'm on tour , everybody is saying what do you want for your birthday ? so i thought well , why not at noon does n't everybody go " peace and love " ? watch people celebrate @entity8 's birthday in @entity55 Â» king : that was something the @entity1 were always concerned with , were n't they , those kind of themes ? @entity8 : well , yes . it was part of our generation , of the ' 60s -- middle ' 60s , of course and , you know , with flower power and peace and love and that -- i 'm just keeping it rolling . that 's what i 'm doing . king : why do you perform ? @entity8 : i perform because that 's what i do . when i was 13 , the dream was to be a drummer . i did n't want to be a guitarist or anything else . i wanted to be a drummer . that happened . i started playing with local musicians and i always wanted to play with the best musicians around . i ended up in the biggest band in the world with the best musicians . i 'm still doing it now . the dream unfolds all the time . i love to play . i love to perform . it 's a lot of fun , and it just happens to be what i do . king : but it 's never a grind ? @entity8 : no. hotels are a grind . the traveling 's always a grind . the good things that come out of that is that for ... two hours and 15 minutes a night , you get a chance to just have a great time . king : how is the all - star band picked ? @entity8 : i picked them because the first rule is that you have to have had a hit in the ' 60s , which i had , ' 70s , which i had , ' 80s or ' 90s . we 're the best 1 - 800 - band that goes live . you know , @entity115 from @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 [ with ] " @entity120 , " @entity114 [ @entity113 ] from the @entity122 . everybody on stage has had hits . the thing is , for the summer collectively , we all get together and support each other . i play on all their songs . they play on mine . some of them i do from the front . i have this other drummer , @entity134 , who is great . he does those and then i get up and play the drums . i win both ways . king : your latest cd is " @entity142 8 , " and it is probably -- not probably , it 's definitely the most personal of your albums . why did you do it ? @entity8 : you 're a writer , i write with friends . people are talking about the actual title track , " @entity142 8 , " which was about my life . the first verse , i was a sailor first ; i was in the @entity150 . i worked in a factory and then i joined @entity152 and that 's when i went professional as a musician , and we played this holiday camp called @entity158 's @entity157 , and then we went to @entity159 and we ended up in [ @entity161 's ] @entity160 [ @entity162 ] . it 's like a mini autobiography . i think that 's what people are getting to . king : how did you get to be a @entity1 ? @entity8 : i got it because i 'm an incredible musician , and i knew the boys , and they gave me -- i was playing with @entity152 . they gave me a call and said , do you want to join the band . i said , sure . that 's how it happened . king : did you like that band right off ? @entity8 : no. i liked that band before i was in it . it was the only band i used to go and see in @entity142 . we became friends before that , before i joined . we were all playing in the same venues . actually , @entity152 and the @entity1 played in @entity185 together . it was n't like i was some stranger they called up . king : did you like the other drummer ? @entity8 : the other drummer was the other drummer , you know . a lot of water has gone under the bridge . they , for their reasons , decided they wanted a change , and i am the result . king : how fortunate for everyone . you and @entity202 are the two still alive . you were with us last year in @entity204 in an extraordinary show . this may be difficult . what was it like to be a @entity1 ? @entity8 : well , it 's difficult , because what was it like ? i mean , it was incredible . it was hard , because when we started we were a club band and then it got bigger and bigger . because we were four brothers together , we supported each other . but you can not not say that it was n't crazy days and reckless nights . that 's what it was . you know , in the end , you know , the one big image that we had , the whole floor of the @entity230 ] in @entity161 and the four of us were hanging out in the bathroom trying to get away from the pressure . king : do you still listen to the @entity1 ? @entity8 : yes , of course i do , some great tracks . my @entity238 is on shuffle . i have @entity1 tracks in it . so they come up and , you know , the music is still , you know -- i love the music . king : why or how do you explain their long lasting ? @entity8 : because they were great songs and , you know , we were incredible musicians who gave those songs incredible life . king : do you think the @entity1 would be a success today ? @entity8 : sure . king : great music is great music . @entity8 : hey , i mean , the kids of today do n't know us really , but they know the music . you know , they 're still listening to it and saying wow ! you talk to any new band , most of them have actually had a listen to what we did . king : anything you want to do , @entity8 , you have n't done ? @entity8 : no , i 'm sort of doing enough . it 's good . and i 'm privileged and blessed that i can do what i want to do , when i want to do it . king : and it 's still -- when you 're on that stage , hitting those drums and the band is going -- @entity8 : love it .
