in a yet another audio recording , @entity1 owner @entity0 purportedly explains why he infamously told a woman not to bring black people to his games : he was jealous that she was with black men . the recording released friday -- the second in two days unveiled by @entity10 -- allegedly reveals @entity0 trying to add context to racist comments that got him banned from the @entity13 last month . that context , he purportedly says , was that he was trying to sleep with the woman he was talking to . " the girl is black . i like her . i 'm jealous that she 's with other black guys . i want her . so what the hell , can i in private tell her , you know , ' i do n't want you to be with anybody ' ? " the man purported to be @entity25 says in the new tape , according to @entity10 . " i 'm trying to have sex with her . i 'm trying to play with her , " the man also says . " you know , if you ( are trying ) to have sex with a girl and you 're talking with her privately , you do n't think anybody 's there . you may say anything in the world . what difference does it make ? " then if the girl tapes it and releases it , my @entity42 , it 's awful . " the new recording is of a phone conversation between @entity0 and an unidentified person , made after the controversy over racist comments erupted last month , @entity10 said . @entity53 's attempts to verify with @entity0 's representatives that he is on the tape were not immediately successful . @entity0 , an 80 - year - old married lawyer and billionaire real - estate investor , has not released a public statement since celebrity gossip website @entity60 posted a 10 - minute audio recording in which he chastised a woman named @entity63 for posting pictures of her posing with african - americans , including basketball @entity66 @entity67 . @entity0 made the comments during an argument with @entity63 , 31 , on april 9 , according to @entity60 . " in your lousy f * * * ing @entity71 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " he says . " if it 's white people , it 's ok ? " responds @entity63 , who is part @entity75 , according to the recording . " if it was @entity82 , would it make a difference ? " although the latest recording claims that @entity0 was jealous , the tapes released last month by @entity60 purportedly reveal @entity0 being ok with @entity63 sleeping with black men . referring to @entity67 , @entity0 purportedly said : " admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity89 ) on an @entity90 for the world to have to see so they have to call me . and do n't bring him to my games . " @entity0 also said , according to @entity60 : " you can sleep with ( black people ) . you can bring them in ; you can do whatever you want . the little i ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games . " one apparent source of friction , according to the pair on the @entity60 tapes , was the man 's view that she " was perceived as either a latina or a white girl , " and that people were calling him with negative reactions to her pictures with black people . " people call you and tell you that i have black people on my @entity90 , and it bothers you , " the woman said . " yeah , it bothers me a lot if you want to ... broadcast that you 're associating with black people . do you have to ? " the man @entity60 identified as @entity0 responded . the @entity60 release triggered a firestorm that led to @entity0 's lifetime ban from the @entity13 and a $ 2.5 million fine . @entity13 commissioner @entity127 has asked the other 29 owners to force @entity0 , the longest - tenured owner in the league , to sell the @entity1 . more from friday 's tape : ' i know i 'm wrong ' in the new tape , the man @entity10 identifies as @entity0 says he was wrong . " i know i 'm wrong , what i said was wrong . but i never thought a private conversation would go anywhere out to the public , " the man says . " i did n't want her to bring anybody to my game because i was jealous . i mean , i 'm being honest , " he continues . in a recording that @entity10 released thursday -- again featuring someone it says is @entity0 talking to an unidentified man -- @entity0 allegedly denies he 's a racist . " you think i 'm a racist ? " a man purported to be @entity0 says . " you think i have anything in the world but love for everybody ? you do n't think that . you know i 'm not a racist . " a second man in that tape says , " they 're trying to force you to sell . " " you ca n't force someone to sell property in @entity163 , " @entity0 purportedly says . " well , i 'm a lawyer ; that 's my opinion . " the matter of the team 's sale is with the @entity13 's @entity168 , which met wednesday in a conference call . members discussed the " termination of mr. @entity0 's ownership of the team , " the @entity13 said in a news release . the committee will meet again next week , the statement said . if the case proceeds to a full vote , 75 % of the owners would have to approve the forced sale . wife wants to retain her ownership share however , an attorney for @entity0 's estranged wife , @entity184 , said friday on @entity53 's " @entity185 " that she wants to keep her 50 % stake in the team and they have been talking by phone with @entity13 officials . " she wants to remain a passive owner , " said attorney @entity191 . " she 's not going to want to manage the team . she 's going to want a very skilled , professional , well - heeled new owner to come in and replace @entity0 , " @entity191 said . " she only wants to own the team in her lifetime . she 's 79 - years - old . at this point , she 's earned it . she 's been an owner for 33 years , and she 's an avid fan . " technically , the team is now owned by the @entity0 family 's trust , with @entity0 and @entity202 serving as co-trustees . their two children are named as beneficiaries . during a news conference announcing @entity25 's lifetime ban , the @entity13 's silver was asked whether there would be sanctions against @entity202 . " no , there have been no decisions about other members of the @entity0 family , and i should say that this ruling applies specifically to @entity0 and @entity0 's conduct only , " @entity127 said . @entity202 has n't done anything wrong and will fight any effort to try to force her to sell her stake in the team , @entity191 said . she has not violated the " the bylaws and constitution of the @entity13 , " he said . " ... the last thing i saw that being a wife of a reviled co-owner is not one of them . " he described the calls by fans and players to force his client to sell her share as " mob psychology . " " i think it 's preposterous to think that players under contract who make tens of millions of dollars a year are going to boycott because a 79 - year - old woman , a passive owner of the team who does n't manager , is sitting in the stands , " @entity191 said . " it 's ridiculous . " @entity191 said @entity202 has denounced her husband 's comments . the @entity25 have not lived together for more than a year . @entity202 is " weighing her options " as to whether she wants a divorce , @entity191 said . he also said she categorically denied making any racist statements , as alleged in court documents filed when the couple was sued for discrimination at their apartment buildings . @entity191 said those allegations were retracted , and the court ultimately decided in favor of the @entity25 . although her husband is banned from @entity13 arenas , @entity202 has attended some of the @entity1 playoff games since the scandal unfolded . opinion : sterling vs. the @entity13 : who has the edge ?
