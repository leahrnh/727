( @entity0 ) -- the headline of this article illustrates the feeling people get when they encounter small , annoying maladies in their vehicles . steering / wheel vibrations are some of the most common . squeaks , rattles , leaks , and vibrations are so irritating to motorists that the carmakers have created a separate category in their labor guides for warranty repair . the average time paid by the manufacturer to track down and repair these annoying gremlins is about a half hour , but most times it actually takes a lot longer than that to identify and make the necessary repair . squeaks & rattles ( @entity25 ) squeaks & rattles ( @entity25 ) usually occur as a result of either two parts rubbing together or as a result of some part that is not quite secure , resulting in a squeak under load . the most common origins of @entity25 are from inside the dashboard , the vehicle 's body , suspension or brakes . whenever a @entity25 develops , try to isolate the noise . does it only happen when braking ? turning ? backing up ? going over a bump ? while driving over a bumpy roadway ? and where does the sound seem to be coming from ? the dash ? under the car ? the front or rear wheels ? once you isolate the approximate location of the noise and when it happens , something can be done about it . air and water leaks what 's leaking ? water or air ? there 's a different diagnostic procedure for finding these leaks . if you have fresh water coming into the vehicle , than you need to determine if it 's coming from outside or inside . if from outside , it could be a leak in the windshield or a body seam . the best way to duplicate this condition is to spray water on the outside of the vehicle in the approximate area where the water is leaking into the vehicle . have someone inside the vehicle trying to find the origin of entry using a flashlight . once you find it , seal the leak . this may require re-sealing the windshield , adjusting the door tighter against the doorjamb gasket , adjusting the door glass tighter against the glass squeegee , or sealing a body seam . whether or not you can repair it yourself depends on your knowledge and access to the necessary equipment . if air is leaking into the vehicle , the best way to duplicate and track down an air leak is to drive the vehicle with another person trying to track down the noise , using either a stethoscope or electronic air leak listening device . once pinpointed , repair of an air leak may require replacement of a door or glass gasket , or the re-sealing of the windshield or a body seam . @entity115 autos : @entity116 least - polluting cars vehicle vibrations vehicle vibrations take various forms . the most common forms fall into the following categories : -- steering / suspension / wheel / tire -- body / chassis -- engine - @entity126 steering / suspension / wheel / tire this category is by far the most popular form of vehicle vibration . tires go out of balance or go bad , steering linkage and suspension components wear out , and wheels get bent . all these conditions can result in steering wheel vibration . @entity115 autos : most popular crossover vehicles say , for instance , you experience a steering wheel vibration at @entity143 , below or above this speed vibration is not present . in such a case , a tire is probably out of balance . worn steering linkage often causes vibration of the steering wheel while driving a rough road , usually after hitting a pothole or some sort of bump in the road . this action sets the steering linkage off into a wild side to side dance that is characterized by a vigorous back and forth motion of the steering wheel . @entity115 autos : cars with the best resale values suspension wear can cause a similar action . check the control arm bushings , ball joints , struts and strut bearings . check the shocks on shock suspensions . finally , a bent wheel or bad tire causes steering wheel vibration that 's always present and intensifies at higher speeds . @entity115 autos : best used luxury cars body / chassis vibration in the body and chassis can be more difficult to track down because it can originate from a location other than where it shows up . this is called telescoping . the best way to track down a body or chassis vibration is via the use of a special electronic listening device called a " @entity191 . " this is an electronic listening device that uses multiple microphones to amplify vibrations , so that they can be more accurately and efficiently tracked down . @entity115 autos : top 10 cars you may overlook engine vibration engine vibration can usually be traced to an engine miss from a bad sparkplug or plug wire , vacuum leak , faulty ignition component , mechanical failure of a cylinder ( such as a broken valve spring , burnt valve , worn piston rings ) , and a host of other stuff . a simple engine diagnostic will bring to light the cause of engine vibration . drivetrain the final category of the most popular vibration complaint is @entity126 vibration , which come from the transmission , axles , differentials , transfer cases and all affiliated components . this type of vibration usually expresses itself throughout the whole vehicle . while accelerating or decelerating you can feel it in the seats , floorboards , steering wheel , and doors ( essentially throughout the entire vehicle ) . it usually intensifies with engine acceleration or deceleration . popular causes of this type of vibration are loose or worn cv or universal joints , bent drive or half shafts , loose transmission output shaft bearings or bushings , or worn differential or transfer case bearings . the next time you hear that annoying squeak or rattle , or feel that irritating vibration , your vehicle is trying to tell you something . do n't put up with it ; get it fixed and avoid bigger problems down the road . ' til next time ... keep @entity258 '

the most popular vibration complaint is @placeholder vibration
