( @entity0 ) -- an @entity2 radio network at the heart of a hoax targeting prince @entity6 's pregnant wife canceled the show responsible for the prank on monday , expressing deep regret for the death of a nurse who took a call from the djs involved . the two @entity13 " will not return to the airwaves until further notice , " the statement from the network , @entity16 , said . the company also suspended all prank calls , pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and processes . the @entity13 , @entity25 and @entity26 , who were impersonating @entity27 and prince @entity28 , called the hospital tuesday and gained some information about the condition of @entity32 -- which they subsequently played on air . on friday , the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward , @entity37 , was found dead after apparently committing suicide . " first and foremost we would like to express our deep and sincere condolences to the family ... for their loss . we are very sorry for what has happened , " @entity44 , the network 's chief executive officer , said in monday 's statement . " we do n't claim to be perfect and we always strive to do better . we have initiated a detailed and rigorous review of our policies and procedures to inform any improvements we can make . " @entity25 and @entity52 also apologized in interviews with the @entity2 tv shows " @entity55 " and " @entity56 " on monday . " there is nothing that can make me feel worse than what i feel right now , " @entity25 said on " @entity56 . " @entity26 told " @entity55 " the prank had become " a tragic turn of events that i do n't think anyone could have predicted or expected . " " i 'm still trying to make sense of it all , " he said , offering " our deepest sympathies " to @entity65 's family . opinion : why airing the prank call was wrong @entity73 's @entity72 have contacted @entity2 authorities in relation to the call , but " are not discussing about what or with who " they 're talking , a spokesman told @entity0 . a spokeswoman for @entity81 in @entity2 told @entity0 : " as the investigation into the death of @entity73 nurse @entity84 continues , @entity81 will be providing @entity73 's @entity72 with whatever assistance they require . " @entity88 , @entity65 's husband , expressed grief over his wife 's death in a post on @entity93 : " i am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife @entity95 in tragic circumstances , she will be laid to rest in @entity86 , @entity87 . " @entity65 's daughter posted a photo of herself with her mother and wrote : " i miss you , i loveeee you . @entity37 . " the chairman of the hospital where the pregnant @entity32 was a patient slammed the @entity2 radio station 's decision to broadcast the recorded prank call as " truly appalling " on saturday , " @entity108 's @entity107 cares for sick people , and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients , let alone actually make the call , " wrote the chairman , @entity106 . " the immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill - considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients . " the longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is , frankly , tragic beyond words . " @entity106 called on the radio station to take steps " to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated .

" a postmortem examination will take place on tuesday , police said monday . a spokesman for prime minister @entity160 said saturday that he " thinks this is a very sad case and his thoughts are with her family and colleagues . " throughout the controversy surrounding the hoax , authorities did not identify the nurse . her identity was released after her death . audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the djs before she put the call through early tuesday morning to the ward where the @entity32 was being treated for acute morning sickness . " they were the world 's worst accents ever , " @entity25 told listeners thursday . " we were sure 100 people at least before us would 've tried the same thing . ... we were expecting to be hung up on . we did n't even know what to say when we got through . " a tweet from @entity188 last week after the incident described it as a " hilarious prank .

" others were outraged , with negative comments outnumbering positive ones on @entity188 's facebook page even before the nurse 's death . " your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people 's lives , " @entity215 wrote . " i know you will say it is harmless fun , the management of @entity188 will say that it wo n't happen again , but this is exactly where the phone hacking scandal started . " the outcry grew exponentially after the hospital confirmed @entity65 's death , leading the @entity233 supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from @entity188 . " this death is on your conscience , " reads one @entity93 post . several accused the two djs of having " blood on your hands . " @entity65 's family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police . she is survived by her husband and two children . " we as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved @entity95 , " said the statement , released by police . @entity65 worked at @entity108 's @entity107 for more than four years , and she was described as an " excellent nurse , " well - respected by co-workers , the hospital statement said . the hospital " had been supporting her throughout this difficult time , " it said . a @entity260 spokesman said : " the @entity261 and @entity32 are deeply saddened to learn of the death . " @entity263 were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at @entity266 , and their thoughts and prayers are with @entity37 's family , friends and colleagues at this very sad time . " separately , a palace spokesman told @entity0 : " at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident . on the contrary , we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times . " @entity0 's @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 contributed to this report .
