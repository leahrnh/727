( @entity0 ) -- as nearly 600 days under siege sap the life and dignity out of the @entity4 in the @entity6 city of @entity7 -- leaving malnourished men with legs like noodles and soot - stained children to dig through homes turned into rubble for bits of firewood -- diplomats in a picturesque @entity18 city bicker over aid . " the situation is unbearable and inhuman . food , there is none . medical supplies , there is none . milk for children , there is none . it is beyond words . " @entity32 tells @entity0 through a crackly @entity34 connection . diplomats at the @entity37 peace negotiations in the @entity18 city reached a yet to be executed deal to evacuate some women and children , according to @entity43 mediator @entity42 , but for those affected , the meek agreement is little more than a consolation prize . '' we will fill our stomach with stones . we do n't want to eat . we do not want your food or your aid supplies . we want to break the siege . there is nothing here anymore ! '' an angry resident yells in one of several social media videos posted online this week by activists hoping to draw attention to their plight . the @entity37 peace talks seemed to matter little to residents living on perpetually empty bellies who demanded all parties put aside their differences to break the almost two - year siege of @entity7 rather than agree to a temporary solution from a reluctant regime . '' we ask @entity37 to break the siege and make us safe roads and get us out of here . i need an urgent operation on my leg . ... we have been around one year and eight months under the siege , and also we do n't want ban ki - moon ... to be worried about us anymore . they have been worrying for more than a year and seven months . poor them , '' an elderly man with crutches sarcastically says in a video posted on social media websites . the @entity86 also urged more action , saying that while the aid organization welcomes the agreement to evacuate women and children from the @entity95 , " a one - shot evacuation will not solve all the problems on the ground , " adding that " it is very crucial to allow impartial humanitarian aid into @entity7 , " @entity85 , an @entity86 spokesman , told @entity0 monday . the appeals appeared to fall on deaf ears , as the opposition @entity100 and the @entity6 government delegation complained to the media monday about the failures of the other party . inside @entity6 's most dangerous city the @entity106 blamed the @entity6 government for the dire situation , accusing it of waging a " kneel or starve campaign . " " the regime is blocking all convoys of aid to @entity7 , and has been doing so for months . the @entity43 with the @entity113 has been trying to get aid these aid convoys through to the city of @entity7 ; the regime is blocking it . the situation is extremely urgent . anything the regime says to the contrary is wrong , " a senior @entity106 official told @entity0 . as the bitter winter cold retains its hold on the restive city , activists and residents say starvation and the lack of basic medical care claim lives regularly as @entity6 troops and some opposition forces prevent the delivery of aid , according to a report from @entity135 last month . " protein , all types of vitamins , vegetables , fruits -- all this is has been extremely scarce over the past eight to 10 months . so for children above the age of 2 and the elderly above 60 , they are most vulnerable to the symptoms of malnutrition , and this is where we see the highest rates of mortality . " dr. @entity152 a neurologist residing in the @entity95 told @entity0 . tree leaves , grass , olives and stale grain are all that 's on the menu at many homes in the old districts of @entity7 , where many residents say they struggle to get just one meal a day on the table while loved ones with preventable diseases languish in a makeshift medical clinic with " medieval health care . " " the world must help us ; they ca n't watch us drown in a sea of suffering , pain and death and do nothing after more than one and a half years of being under siege " the rev. @entity177 , a @entity178 and longtime @entity6 resident , said in broken @entity180 on social media . months after the start of an uprising against the government of president @entity185 , the western city and once - thriving industrial center gave birth to an armed rebellion . that triggered a brutal @entity6 troop bombardment in what human rights groups called an act of collective punishment on the city . over the course of several months , @entity6 forces , backed by @entity199 militants , moved in on the so - called capital of the revolution . they pushed insurgents out of one neighborhood after another until troops established a chokehold around the neighborhoods of @entity210 , separating the district from the @entity213 area and wresting control of the strategic border city of @entity216 . the approximately 3,000 people left behind suffered in silence for months without a single international aid convoy or international observer breaching the siege as food and medical stores dwindled along with the calcium in children 's bones , the milk in mothers ' breasts , and the protein in fathers ' muscles . " i have personally seen so many infants die due to lack of adequate treatment or professional care because we have no pediatricians , incubators , or obstetricians . so from the moment a child is conceived , they suffer under this siege , " said dr. @entity241 , who along with colleagues , issued a list of needed medical supplies to the international community , including powdered milk for infants and vials of electrolytes . in the gray ruins of the @entity95 , a simple fall may shatter a child 's thin , malnourished bones , and stunted toddlers smile with teeth blackened by decay as they play hide - and - seek . doctors tell @entity0 that without intervention from the international community , " more people will die . " " i think that there is a lack of pressure from the international community on the barbaric regime . it is inhuman that they are fighting us over a loaf of bread . cutting of water , electricity , and preventing any aid organization from entering . this situation reflects poorly on the international community to help these besieged areas , " @entity241 said . @entity282 refugees starving to death in @entity6 camp , human rights groups say

the @placeholder peace talks produced a small deal to evacuate women and children
