( @entity0 ) -- it all happened so fast . in january , less than a month after fruit vendor @entity4 lit himself on fire , nationwide protests in @entity3 forced out president @entity8 @entity7 . one month later , @entity9 experienced its own revolution , and unrest spread across the region to other countries such as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 . but in the last couple of months , it seems , the rate of change has slowed . a stalemate has developed in @entity24 's civil war . government leaders are n't budging in @entity14 or @entity16 , and @entity17 's future is still up in the air . so what happens next ? is more change on the way , or have we already seen the peak of what some call the " @entity35 " ? @entity0 reached out to five experts for opinion and analysis . more specifically , we posed the following question : how do you see the " @entity35 " playing out as we move toward the summer months ? @entity41 : expect regime change in @entity24 , @entity17 @entity41 , a @entity43 specialist who lived in @entity9 for four years , is a political scientist at the @entity45 it is likely that we will see at least two more regime transitions in the next six months . one is @entity17 , where the ruling party has agreed to have president ( @entity49 step down . it is not clear whether @entity49 is on board with the deal -- if the opposition rejects the portion of the agreement that would protect @entity49 and his family from prosecution , the president 's departure might be delayed . but it will still be imminent . @entity49 enjoys little support both inside and outside of @entity17 , and all parties are growing frustrated with his attempts to drag out the inevitable . another is @entity24 , where most think any resolution that keeps ( @entity67 ) @entity66 in power and divides the country is untenable . @entity16 is harder to call . the protesters are unrelenting , but -- unlike in @entity17 -- troop leaders in @entity16 's armed forces are highly committed to @entity49 ( @entity74 ) @entity73 . their fates are tied to the maintenance of the regime because they are from the same minority @entity79 sect . @entity80 also has the ability to initiate a mass crackdown , and the regime 's primary patron , @entity85 , would likely support such a move . overall , prospects for consolidated democracies look somewhat bleak . prior to the revolutions , a network of civil society groups had developed in @entity9 and @entity3 , cultivating a civic culture that promoted popular engagement and democracy . but the two countries still struggle to establish democratic systems . the countries in a possible " second wave " of @entity100 revolutions have even dimmer prospects . other than tribes , @entity24 essentially has no civil society , and it has a long - isolated educated class . @entity17 has civil society organizations but fewer well - educated individuals or solid state institutions . and @entity16 , despite its comparatively well - educated population , has virtually no civil society ; removal of the regime would likely devolve into a civil conflict between @entity79 and majority @entity113 . @entity116 : ' we are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist ' @entity116 is deputy director of the @entity119 . one major lesson that @entity3 and @entity9 shared with their fellow @entity100 is that dictatorships do have an end and that they can be abolished sooner than many think . furthermore , they inspired the entire region with their success , breaking the barrier of fear and replacing it with a pragmatic optimism that change can be achieved . however , the other half of the story that remains is the question of what it takes to effect democratic change in the region . in particular , it is becoming increasingly obvious that a smooth overthrow of entrenched dictators is quite an elusive goal . the @entity3 and @entity9 paradigm of regime change in three weeks probably can not be repeated . in the coming months , a new paradigm for political transition will likely emerge in the @entity100 world . we should be prepared to see different means of quelling public unrest in the region . possible new scenarios include civil wars , coups , disintegrations , sectarian tension , external intervention , internationalization and negotiated political settlements . the countries at risk -- particularly @entity24 , @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity14 -- are unlikely to follow one particular path because each one of them has its own set of dynamics and domestic drivers for change . in @entity3 and @entity9 , we have seen people inspiring others to revolt ; however , in the new paradigm , we are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist . it is true the emergence of these new dynamics is likely to make the process of political change longer and more complicated . but regardless of how long this process takes , the @entity100 public has learned that the time has come for aging dictators to depart -- and that the only option at this point is to move forward with the long - overdue call for freedom and justice . @entity187 : @entity100 world has the money to solve its problems @entity187 , author of " how to @entity191 : charting a course to the @entity195 , " is a senior research fellow with the @entity193 . as the " @entity35 " moves into summer , things are likely to remain hot . while it is anyone 's guess what will happen in @entity24 -- consolidation or partition are still equally viable scenarios -- tensions will surely rise in @entity9 as government reforms falter and election preparations ramp up . and @entity14 might have quelled the protests in its streets , but it will have done little to address the core sectarian inequalities that are a key driver of its present instability . importantly , the bottom - up push for accountability will continue as long as citizens , business groups and other reformers keep the pressure on for emergency laws to be repealed , parliaments to be strengthened and economic reforms to be undertaken . particularly with respect to the economy , private creditors and outside agencies such as the @entity223 can play a valuable role in forcing governments in @entity9 and @entity16 to loosen their economic grip faster than entrenched elites would like . the role of the @entity231 , which includes countries such as @entity233 , @entity234 and the @entity235 , will remain pivotal and come ever more into the spotlight . these oil - rich states have been key investors across the @entity100 world and play a vital role in financing the necessary structural economic modernization the region needs . remember that the @entity100 world is not the third world -- it has all the money it needs to solve its own problems . the question is if it can overcome the stale arabism of the past , which affirmed insecure nationalism , in favor of a new arabism that champions trans - @entity100 interdependence . @entity253 : odds stacked against @entity16 revolution @entity253 is an assistant professor for the political science department at the @entity257 . the events in @entity3 and @entity9 offer hope that uprisings elsewhere in the @entity43 and @entity261 will meet with success . perhaps most striking are the events unfolding in @entity16 , where few predicted mass protests against @entity266 's regime and where the conventional wisdom suggests that past repression , ethnic - religious diversity and relative popularity would shield @entity73 . in many ways , the events in @entity16 draw strong parallels to @entity9 . in the hopes of appeasing protesters , @entity73 offers concessions every few days -- a lifting of the niqab ban , offering citizenship to @entity279 and promising to rescind emergency law . but much like ( @entity9 president @entity281 ) @entity281 , @entity73 constantly appears to be a step behind the protesters ' demands . while the magnitude of @entity16 protests is impressive , the fate of @entity73 's regime remains an open question . specifically , a loyal military and the legacy of limited association rights significantly diminish the prospects of a successful revolution in the country . in @entity9 , protesters benefited from relatively strong @entity297 ( nongovernmental organizations ) and experience with activism , but @entity16 has a more limited and restricted civil society . data from the @entity303 reveal that there are nearly five times more civil society organizations per capita in @entity9 than @entity16 . except for the @entity309 revolt in 1982 and @entity279 demonstrations in 2004 , political protest in @entity16 has been minimal . all of this suggests that @entity16 protesters have less local political experience and knowledge , fewer resources and smaller networks that they can tap into . these deficiencies limit protesters ' ability to pressure the regime and ensure it is held accountable for its actions . @entity323 : revolts leave a ' powerful legacy ' @entity323 teaches @entity43 politics at the @entity327 at the @entity328 , and he is author of " the people reloaded : the @entity330 and the struggle for @entity85 's future . " the notion of an " @entity35 " is a misnomer because it assumes that the @entity100 world is a monolith . yes , these uprisings are motivated by common political and economic grievances rooted in decades of authoritarian rule . and , yes , the protesters aspire to common democratic objectives . but each country in the @entity100 world is different . each has its own internal story and confronts different obstacles related to class and minority cleavages , the strength of the military and state institutions , and the unity and democratic orientation of the opposition forces . moreover , the nature and character of the forms of authoritarian rule in the @entity100 world -- and the devastation they have wrought -- pose different challenges for democrats moving forward . there is cause for optimism even if we assume a worst - case scenario where democratic forces are crushed in @entity24 , @entity16 , @entity17 and beyond . were this to happen , these revolts would still leave behind a powerful legacy that future democratic forces can build upon , buttressed by the successful of examples of @entity3 and @entity9 , where the prospects for democracy appear to be the greatest . regardless of how many democratic transitions we witness this year , the tide of history has turned . the days are numbered for @entity100 authoritarian regimes , and those who argue that @entity380 / @entity100 culture is incompatible with democracy are left scrambling .

the exception might be @placeholder , where the odds seem to be stacked against protesters
