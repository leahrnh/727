( @entity0 ) -- imagine if it were possible to build your own home , in this day and age , for less than $ 35,000 . or to cut up some timber and piece your new home together like a giant jigsaw puzzle . what if you could create , with your own hands , a home that collects its own rainwater and generates its own power , so you never have to pay a bill again ? as far - fetched as it sounds , if you ca n't afford to buy a house , then designing and building your own may be more viable than you assumed . today , upcoming architects and designers are coming up with solutions to the problem of rocketing property prices , by building houses of their own and sharing their plans on the internet . in the @entity25 , a young architectural practice has devised the world 's first ' open - source ' building . made of simple materials and freely available plans , the ' @entity30 ' was conceived by @entity32 designer @entity31 as a low - cost solution to the global housing shortage . the aim of the project is to allow anyone in the world to design , share , download , adapt and ' print ' a house that is inexpensive and tailored to their own needs . construction of the house requires no special parts and the entire building can be made from pieces of timber that snap together . according to its inventors , the frame of the @entity30 can be assembled in under a day , by people with absolutely no construction training . using a @entity56 machine , amateur builders can download cutting files from the company 's website and then " print " the component parts of the @entity30 from a sheet of plywood . @entity31 says that the motivation for designing cheap , easy - to - build housing was to help make architecture more accessible . " the open secret is that in reality almost everything we today call architecture is actually design for the 1 % , " @entity31 says . " the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how , for the first time , we will make our client not the 1 % but the 100 % -- to radically democratize the production of architecture . " for @entity31 , spreading affordable housing requires the empowerment of amateurs . " we are moving into a future where the factory can be everywhere -- and increasingly the design team can be everyone . we need to build tools and institutions for the social economy -- the ' long tail ' of people who are making for themselves , " @entity31 says . this same spirit is present in @entity93 ' grassroots project ' @entity94 ' , in which he built a home for $ 33,200 . @entity93 documented his efforts to create his house online to inspire others who might wish to follow his lead . the blog features comprehensive photography and information on the building process , plus professional plans and cartoon instructions that are simple enough for almost anyone to follow . @entity93 ' self - built home is a stunningly impressive three bedroom house that looks like it 's been ripped from the pages of @entity110 . the building 's bright living spaces and high quality finish belie its low price . according to @entity93 , the house was primarily made from timber , and its roof is clad with a lightweight corrugated material called onduline . the house was largely constructed by a small group of @entity93 ' friends over the course of a long weekend ( plus a little extra time to get the project finalized ) . after sharing his plans online , @entity93 says that he received significant interest from people hoping to build their own home . " by sharing my plans , i hope that it might be inspirational to people who have the skills , or will , or wish to put their own house together . " @entity93 has also found that making his plans publicly available has actually stimulated his business . " i think if you open up and submit to sharing things , you get it all back , " he says . @entity138 , development director at the @entity139 warns that not everyone will necessarily be able to build their own home : " @entity93 ' project is inspiring -- a fantastic home created for a fraction of the usual cost , however the time and energy required to do this make it difficult for the ' average person ' to undertake . " seeking a cheaper lifestyle and a more ecological existence , @entity151 built his own ' @entity154 ' in @entity155 back in 2009 for just $ 4,600 ( Â £ 3,000 ) . @entity151 says the whole building was constructed with a hammer , a one - inch chisel and a chainsaw , and was made largely of scavenged materials . @entity151 says " anything you could possibly want is in a rubbish pile somewhere -- windows , burner , plumbing , wiring . " @entity151 , who has no training as a builder , built his eco-home with the help of a few friends and family members . the eco-home uses water from a nearby stream , and is heated by a wood burning stove with wood gathered from the surrounding forests . the property has a compost toilet , and is powered by solar panels on the roof . famous architects have also been turning their minds to the global housing crisis . @entity187 , the designer of the @entity188 -- @entity190 's tallest building -- recently unveiled a working model for the ' @entity192 ' -- the smallest scale project he has ever mounted , which attempts to create a functional micro home that is fully featured but at an economical scale . @entity187 's @entity198 house is designed to function self - sufficiently . water is collected by the house , then cleaned and reused . the house also generates its own power through solar panels mounted on the roof . architecture critic @entity204 says that @entity187 's design addresses many of the housing crisis 's central problems : " we live in an age in which the demand for sustainability forces us to minimize our ecological footprint . this is paired with the desire to concentrate and reduce the direct living environment to the truly essential things . " @entity138 says that individuals building their own houses may be critical to the future of home ownership : " self build and custom build offer people a real alternative to buying a new home , and allows them to define the environment in which they live . most projects use local labor and materials which helps stimulate the economy around them .
