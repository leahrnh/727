it 's the cup of brandy that no one wants to drink . on tuesday , in @entity4 , @entity5 , the surviving @entity3 will gather publicly for the last time . they once were among the most universally admired and revered men in the @entity8 . there were 80 of the @entity10 in april 1942 , when they carried out one of the most courageous and heart - stirring military operations in this nation 's history . the mere mention of their unit 's name , in those years , would bring tears to the eyes of grateful @entity8 . now only four survive . after @entity25 's sneak attack on @entity26 , with the @entity8 reeling and wounded , something dramatic was needed to turn the war effort around . even though there were no friendly airfields close enough to @entity25 for the @entity8 to launch a retaliation , a daring plan was devised . sixteen b - 25s were modified so that they could take off from the deck of an aircraft carrier . this had never before been tried -- sending such big , heavy bombers from a carrier . the 16 five - man crews , under the command of lt. col. @entity39 , who himself flew the lead plane off the @entity41 , knew that they would not be able to return to the carrier . they would have to hit @entity25 and then hope to make it to @entity46 for a safe landing . but on the day of the raid , the @entity25 military caught wind of the plan . the @entity10 were told that they would have to take off from much farther out in the @entity52 than they had counted on . they were told that because of this they would not have enough fuel to make it to safety . and those men went anyway . they bombed @entity59 , and then flew as far as they could . four planes crash - landed ; 11 more crews bailed out , and three of the @entity10 died . eight more were captured ; three were executed . another died of starvation in a @entity25 prison camp . one crew made it to @entity70 . the @entity3 sent a message from the @entity8 to its enemies , and to the rest of the world : we will fight . and , no matter what it takes , we will win . of the 80 @entity10 , 62 survived the war . they were celebrated as national heroes , models of bravery . @entity83 produced a motion picture based on the raid ; " @entity86 , " starring @entity87 and @entity88 , was a patriotic and emotional box - office hit , and the phrase became part of the national lexicon . in the movie - theater previews for the film , @entity83 proclaimed that it was presenting the story " with supreme pride . " beginning in 1946 , the surviving @entity10 have held a reunion each april , to commemorate the mission . the reunion is in a different city each year . in 1959 , the city of @entity102 , @entity103 , as a gesture of respect and gratitude , presented the @entity3 with a set of 80 silver goblets . each goblet was engraved with the name of a raider . every year , a wooden display case bearing all 80 goblets is transported to the reunion city . each time a raider passes away , his goblet is turned upside down in the case at the next reunion , as his old friends bear solemn witness . also in the wooden case is a bottle of 1896 @entity125 cognac . the year is not happenstance : 1896 was when @entity126 was born . there has always been a plan : when there are only two surviving @entity10 , they would open the bottle , at last drink from it , and toast their comrades who preceded them in death . as 2013 began , there were five living @entity10 ; then , in february , @entity137 passed away at age 96 . the name may be familiar to those of you who regularly read this column ; in 2011 , i wrote about the role mr. @entity137 played at his son 's wedding . what a man he was . after bailing out of his plane over a mountainous @entity46 forest after the @entity59 raid , he became ill with malaria , and almost died . when he recovered , he was sent to @entity153 to fly more combat missions . he was shot down , captured , and spent 22 months in a @entity156 prisoner of war camp . the selflessness of these men , the sheer guts ... there was a passage in the @entity163 obituary for mr. @entity137 that , on the surface , had nothing to do with the war , but that emblematizes the depth of his sense of duty and devotion : " when his wife became ill and needed to go into a nursing home , he visited her every day . he walked from his house to the nursing home , fed his wife and at the end of the day brought home her clothes . at night , he washed and ironed her clothes . then he walked them up to her room the next morning . he did that for three years until her death in 2005 . " so now , out of the original 80 , only four @entity10 remain : @entity183 ( @entity3 's co-pilot on the @entity59 raid ) , @entity184 , @entity184 and @entity186 . all are in their 90s . they have decided that there are too few of them for the public reunions to continue . the events in @entity4 this week will mark the end . it has come full circle ; @entity5 's nearby @entity197 was where the @entity10 trained in secrecy for the @entity59 mission . the town is planning to do all it can to honor the men : a six - day celebration of their valor , including luncheons , a dinner and a parade . do the men ever wonder if those of us for whom they helped save the country have tended to it in a way that is worthy of their sacrifice ? they do n't talk about that , at least not around other people . but if you find yourself near @entity4 this week , and if you should encounter any of the @entity10 , you might want to offer them a word of thanks . i can tell you from firsthand observation that they appreciate hearing that they are remembered . the men have decided that after this final public reunion they will wait until a later date -- some time this year -- to get together once more , informally and in absolute privacy . that is when they will open the bottle of brandy . the years are flowing by too swiftly now ; they are not going to wait until there are only two of them . they will fill the four remaining upturned goblets . and raise them in a toast to those who are gone .

this year , there are four left . they 'll toast the @placeholder with aged cognac , and end reunions
