( @entity0 ) -- since the start of the financial crisis , the world 's wealthiest man , investor @entity5 , has been front and center . @entity8 says investor @entity5 has become a symbol of stability in @entity12 business . he 's advised sen. @entity13 on economic policy . he urged @entity15 to pass the $ 700 billion bailout bill . he bought stakes in @entity18 and @entity19 . he wrote an op - ed piece in the @entity21 saying he 's buying stock in @entity12 companies now because he believes they will do well in the long run , citing as his rule : " be greedy when others are fearful . " @entity5 's name came up in the second presidential debate when the candidates agreed he 'd be a good choice for treasury secretary . his fortune was estimated at $ 62 billion by @entity34 in march . @entity8 got @entity5 's cooperation in writing her new book , " @entity37 : @entity5 and the @entity38 " ( @entity39 ) . @entity8 , who worked on @entity40 as an insurance industry analyst , met @entity5 10 years ago when his company , @entity42 , bought a big insurance company . @entity8 says she suggested he write a book about his life , and the 78 - year - old @entity5 turned the tables , urging her to do it instead . @entity8 estimates she spent about 2,000 hours with @entity5 and interviewed 250 people for the book . now on a tour to promote her book , @entity8 is in a unique position to speak about @entity5 at a time when many media outlets are seeking his views . " i have about 300 hours of recorded interviews and the rest of the time i observed him , i watched him make decisions and talk on the phone , went through files . i got to sit in his office for weeks , i ate steaks with him , " says @entity8 , who 's 51 . " if it ever said moo , he 'll pretty much eat it . he likes his steaks bloody rare and hanging off the plate , they 're so big . " @entity0 : why are people so interested in @entity5 ? @entity8 : i think he 's transcended business to become a national figure because of people 's trust in him as a symbol of stability and a symbol of someone who knows how to manage risk and avoid catastrophe and of how to run a business on principles . @entity0 : is there any realistic possibility of him taking a government position ? @entity8 : no , none . what he really likes to do is run @entity42 , and he 's not going to let anything take him away from that . he 's also not going to let anyone spend his day filled up with meetings or schedule his time , he 's too independent . @entity0 : you make clear that in the 1990s tech boom , @entity40 turned away from @entity5 and there was some criticism of him . do you think that now , because of the market downturn , people will look to him more to set a standard of how the market operates ? @entity8 : i think it 's fair to say that throughout his career , every time there 's been a bubble and it 's burst , his reputation has grown . that happened in the 1960s , when the bubble burst in the 1970s , it happened again after 1987 . it happened again after the savings and loan crisis . ... it happened again after the internet bubble and it 's happening now . @entity0 : it does n't seem to have had a lasting effect , since we keep going back into another boom period or bubble . @entity8 : he would say that human nature does n't change , and that fear and greed are always the two drivers of the market . and there are people who listen when he gives learnings , but that the market will always be ruled by cycles driven by fear and greed . @entity0 : have you talked to him about the current market turmoil ? @entity8 : last spring , when @entity137 was being taken over by @entity138 ... he talked about the dominoes falling , and how , if that happened , the government could face some very unpleasant choices and have to take drastic measures . with hindsight it looks really prescient . in 2002 , he talked about derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction . more recently , his observation was that there was a lot of anger and denial at first about what was going on , and that people were not quite grasping the gravity of the situation and how quickly and dramatically they needed to move . he always says , do n't sell into a panic , do n't let the fear and the emotions of the market change how you feel . if you own good stocks in good companies or you own an index of the markets , and you see it getting cheaper , that 's a reason to be happy , not to panic and sell . ... the idea is buy low , sell high -- not buy high , sell low . he understands the factors that are burdening the country , the federal deficit , the consumer debt , the infrastructure spending that we 're going to have to do , but he has a belief in @entity12 ingenuity which over the long term has enabled our country to solve problems that seemed insurmountable in the past . for example , in the 1970s , it looked like the country could not ever dig its way out of the mess . so he does have a faith in the long - term prospects of the country . @entity0 : is he a gambler ? @entity8 : no , he 's a handicapper -- big difference . a handicapper is somebody who understands odds - making . a gambler is somebody who bets but may not even understand the odds . @entity5 believes in a margin of safety , he does n't bet unless the odds are overwhelmingly in his favor . when he goes to @entity204 he does not gamble , he goes to see the shows . @entity0 : what are his flaws ? @entity8 : he is somebody who can be very tough in business and very impersonal , including with people he likes . and in personal relationships , he negotiates as if it were a business relationship when he was putting @entity42 together , as [ his business partner ] @entity213 puts it , he was an implacable acquirer . the book refers to him , in my words , as a great white shark , and the book describes the battle between his avarice and his higher principles . at times , his avarice won . and over his lifetime , it 's been essentially a progress during which his higher principles have increasingly had the upper hand . but when he was in junior high , he was a shoplifter . he was a juvenile delinquent . he sold his sister 's bicycle . it 's been pretty much uphill from there , but it has n't been a straight line . @entity0 : in his adult life , was there a time when his avarice won out over higher principles ? @entity8 : absolutely , he 's made investments that he should n't have made , for example , when he invested in @entity246 . he was criticizing @entity40 and saying if you want to make a lot of money , hold your nose and go to @entity40 , and at the same time he was already there . @entity42 owned $ 700 million of convertible preferred [ stock ] in a major @entity40 bank . and he was sort of mentally distancing himself from a business that he was invested in . that kind of separation is something that 's very hard to maintain . and in the end , he had to become interim chairman of @entity246 to rescue the firm . psychologically , he was trying to distance himself from it because the two sides of him were at war . @entity0 : is he still critical of @entity40 ? @entity8 : you 've got an economy in which financial intermediaries who do n't add anything to the economy ... have in the past two decades stripped off huge amounts of fees , particularly buyout funds , and hedge funds and funds of funds , and he 's very , very critical of the amount of fees that have been taken out . he has no problem with executive pay when it 's related to performance . he thinks in most cases executives are being paid to sit in a chair whether they perform or not . and he 's pointed out that these people are not like major league baseball players , who get recruited away by other teams . when ceos get fired and they get these golden parachutes , you do n't normally see them winding up somewhere else , right ? so they 're getting paid these huge amounts of money as an incentive to stay and then they get paid the consolation prize when they get fired . the pay is always getting ratcheted upward , they 're getting paid to incent them to stay and they 're getting paid to console them when they leave , no matter what the shareholders are getting . it 's not aligned with anything the shareholders get , that really bothers him . @entity0 : what would he say about coping with an economic downturn ? @entity8 : that people should think for the long run and make their personal decisions for the long run and build a margin of safety into their lives as best they can . think about what could go wrong . do n't assume the best - case scenario . if you 've got debts , your first thought should be how to pay them off , and negotiate with creditors if you 're struggling , because they 'll usually be flexible . and be realistic about what you can afford , because having a financial cushion means you can sleep at night , and that 's worth more than a big - screen tv .
