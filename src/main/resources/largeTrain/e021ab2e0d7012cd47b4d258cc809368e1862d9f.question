@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity5 vice presidential candidate @entity4 's boast to have opposed the infamous " bridge to nowhere " is a staple of the @entity1 governor 's stump speech , but her record is more complicated than the one - liner . @entity1 gov. @entity4 canceled work on the @entity13 in 2007 after initially supporting the project . she repeated the line tuesday in @entity16 , @entity17 , telling supporters , " i told @entity19 , ' thanks , but no thanks ' for that bridge to nowhere up in @entity1 . if our state wanted a bridge , we were going to build it ourselves . " but @entity4 originally supported construction of the bridge , which would have linked the city of @entity28 with its airport on sparsely populated @entity13 . " i 'm not going to stand in the way of progress that our congressional delegation -- in the position of strength that they have right now -- they 're making those efforts for the state of @entity1 to build up our infrastructure , " @entity4 said during a debate shortly before her 2006 election as governor . " i would not get in the way of progress of this project or other projects they 're working so hard on . " her office canceled work on the span in 2007 after it became a symbol of congressional " pork - barrel " excess , but kept money that @entity19 had appropriated for the project , using the funds instead for state transportation projects . @entity4 has n't faced reporters since sen. @entity58 tapped her as his running mate . a former aide said @entity4 turned against the $ 223 million @entity13 bridge when the original price nearly doubled . watch an ex-aide defend @entity4 's position on the bridge » " it was a different bridge when she was a candidate than the bridge when she became governor , " @entity66 said . @entity66 said @entity4 " knows that we can do it for far less , and she knows the state can handle it . " in a statement announcing the cancellation of the @entity13 project , @entity4 complained that public opposition to the bridge " is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here . " " but we need to focus on what we can do , rather than fight over what has happened , " she said in the statement . campaign aides also have had to explain the fine print on another applause line from @entity4 's stump speech -- that she put the luxury jet her predecessor purchased for state travel up for sale on @entity93 . although the jet was for sale on the online auction site , it failed to draw sufficient bids and was later sold at a loss through an ordinary aircraft brokerage . democrats also are trying to exploit a gap between @entity58 's famous opposition to congressional earmarks and @entity4 's efforts to obtain those appropriations for @entity1 during her time as governor and as mayor of the @entity1 town of @entity110 . @entity4 has sought about $ 450 million in earmarks from the state 's congressional delegation since becoming governor , and about $ 27 million for @entity110 during her second term as mayor from 1998 to 2002 , according to state records and documents from the @entity120 - based watchdog group @entity119 . " all the things that @entity58 says [ are ] bad , she lobbied to get , " sen. @entity121 , the @entity122 presidential candidate , said monday . " when it came to the bridge to nowhere , she was for it until everybody started raising a fuss about it . " @entity121 added , " you ca n't just make stuff up . you ca n't just recreate yourself , you ca n't just reinvent yourself . the @entity134 people are n't stupid . " the bridge was backed by the senior members of @entity1 's congressional delegation -- rep. @entity138 , the former chairman of the @entity140 , and sen. @entity141 . @entity142 of @entity143 said @entity4 gets credit for taking on her fellow republicans over the issue . " anyone who takes on @entity141 and @entity138 when it comes to transportation is taking on two very powerful interests in @entity120 , " @entity142 said . @entity138 is fighting to hold the seat he has occupied for more than three decades against lt. gov. @entity152 , a @entity5 challenger @entity4 supported against the veteran congressman . @entity141 , who also is trying to be re-elected this year , has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of lying on his @entity156 ethics disclosure forms and is pushing for a trial before november 's election . while @entity122 have questioned her campaign claims , some @entity1 see @entity4 as a modern - day @entity161 who has returned money to taxpayers . the rising price of oil has bolstered the state 's balance sheets , allowing @entity1 to sock away $ 5 billion in savings -- in large part because of an increase in the tax on oil companies that @entity4 supported . the state 's @entity174 is now worth more than $ 35 billion , and @entity4 approved payments of $ 3,269 to every @entity1 resident this year -- a $ 1,200 increase in the annual dividend each resident receives . " she has helped to balance our budget . she has done a very good job , " @entity1 @entity183 said . " she gave , she fought to get us a little bit of extra money in these hard economic times . " watch a look at @entity4 's fiscal priorities » but state spending has increased under her tenure . and while she has used her line - item veto to cut funds for some government programs , her critics in @entity1 complain she has the wrong priorities . " for a drop in the bucket , every single kid in the state could have health insurance , " said state rep. @entity198 , a @entity199 from @entity0 . " for a drop in the bucket , we do n't have to be one of the worst states in terms of high school graduation rates . " @entity2 's @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .
