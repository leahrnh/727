@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 was raising a quiet , socially awkward young man , the kind of teenager who , a former classmate recalled , would just go stand in the corner . @entity11 herself seemed nothing like her boy . she was affable and outgoing , and easily made friends . sure , she liked guns , say people who knew her . but she was responsible with them . she knew how to handle the weapons she collected . how @entity20 apparently got hold of at least a few of them to commit a massacre in an elementary school is still unclear . authorities believe he killed his mother as she slept in her bed . she was shot four times in the head , @entity1 chief medical examiner h. @entity29 said tuesday . then , authorities say , @entity20 went to @entity34 -- which he 'd once attended -- and killed 20 children and six adults . then , he used a handgun to kill himself with a shot to the front of the head , @entity37 said . friend , classmate describe family a friend of @entity3 , who had done contracting work for her , was last in the home eight months ago and remembers seeing a lock box in the basement where @entity11 kept her guns . he describes her as a country girl from @entity54 who grew up shooting . the two of them bonded , partly because both had family members with autism , the friend said . he also said he met @entity20 , who did not make eye contact or engage in conversation . @entity11 tried hard to mainstream her son , the friend said . he now questions whether she tried too hard to have him " fit in . " he says she took her son with her to the gun range because , she said , she could n't always leave him at home . on monday , just a few days after the massacre at the school , a schoolmate of @entity20 told @entity2 that he bumped into @entity3 a while ago . @entity71 , 20 , who was a freshman at @entity72 when @entity20 was a sophomore , asked her how her son was doing . to @entity71 , it seemed that @entity20 just disappeared from high school after his sophomore year , but it turns out that @entity11 , then 16 , was taking classes at @entity78 , a school spokesman said . it was hard to forget a kid like @entity20 . " i would call him a genius , " @entity71 said . @entity11 got a 3.26 gpa at @entity78 , including an a in a computer class , the school spokesman told @entity2 , but @entity11 took his last class in 2009 and did n't come back . when @entity71 and @entity11 were classmates , @entity71 went out of his way to include @entity20 when few others would , he said . it worked , for a little while . @entity11 opened up , sometimes telling jokes to the other students . there he 'd be , in the same plaid green button - up shirt and his khakis -- the weird kid , telling jokes . so those few years later , seeing @entity20 's mother , @entity71 just had to ask : how are things going with @entity20 ? " when i talked to @entity103 that time , about how he was doing , she said he 's been going to the ( gun ) range a lot recently , " @entity71 told @entity2 . " that he 'd taken that up as a hobby .

' @entity165 ' cries out for help @entity2 spoke with a friend of @entity3 who said she 'd grown concerned about @entity20 lately , worrying about what she was going to do with her boy who was growing up , maybe in the way that all mothers worry . she talked about wanting to sell her house and move @entity174 , and was eyeing @entity175 . @entity11 was n't debilitated , though , by her worry . she still got out there and lived . she went on short vacations and went to @entity180 games . the friend asked not to be named . a ' normal family ' and target shooting " it was just a nice , normal family , " neighbor @entity184 said saturday , recalling how she and other women on the street would often go to each others ' houses to play cards . @entity3 preferred to garden . " we used to joke with her that she 'd do all this landscaping that no one could see because it all was in the back ( of the house ) , " @entity191 said . @entity3 also collected guns , say those who knew her . @entity200 , who owns a local landscaping business , said she showed off a rifle she recently purchased . " she told me she 'd go target shooting with her boys pretty often , " @entity200 said . @entity3 kept a lot of weapons , from assault rifles to handguns , at her home . the weapons were for self - defense , said @entity11 , @entity140 's sister . yet , @entity11 said her former sister - in - law " never felt threatened . " if she did , @entity11 said , @entity103 would have spoken up about it . @entity103 was self - reliant , a trait that she possibly picked up while growing up on a farm in @entity54 , @entity11 said . groups : autism not to blame for violence at some point , she worked in finance in @entity223 and @entity1 , a friend said . she was not a teacher , as some media had previously reported , the friend added . despite whatever problems @entity3 might have been facing behind closed doors , on the outside she kept a cheerful face . several people who knew her said she was incredibly social and warm . several nights a week , she got take - out from the @entity236 bar in @entity0 . @entity2 sat down with owners @entity237 , @entity239 and @entity240 . @entity237 recalled @entity103 starting a conversation with her , and how they become fast friends . " she 's funny . we took to her , " said @entity243 . " she did a lot in town and was always on the go . " @entity248 said @entity3 worked in charities for people with @entity251 , and said she was extremely generous . @entity237 saw @entity3 take out her checkbook and write checks to anyone who told her they were going through a rough time and needed money . " she was very kind , " @entity237 said . @entity11 was generally in a good mood , several people said . " every time i saw her , she was so giddy and happy , " said @entity261 , 23 , @entity71 's sister . @entity261 also knew @entity20 , and knew that @entity103 owned guns . " she was very responsible . she transported them safely . it was n't something she boasted about , " @entity261 told @entity2 . yet when she heard the news that there had been a shooting at @entity34 , @entity261 started calling @entity3 's cell phone . as the young woman recalls this terrible moment , she weeps . i was " hoping it was n't true , " she said . @entity3 's guns the three weapons found at the scene of the shooting were legally purchased by @entity3 , a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told @entity2 . statement from @entity20 's father the @entity283 is investigating the school shooting . @entity2 confirmed monday afternoon with @entity283 that @entity20 and his mother frequented several gun ranges over the past several years . the agency will not identify which ranges . @entity288 , a friend of @entity3 , said she was the " epitome of responsibility . " " they 've painted her as some irresponsible gun freak , but she was n't , " he said . " she was a paragon for gun safety . she taught the boys how to use the guns responsibly . " police chief @entity298 said he , too , knew @entity3 . " she was a great person who would do anything for you , a heart of gold , " he told the @entity300 newspaper . " she was just a real , real nice , nice person . " @entity71 keeps asking the same question everyone is : how could this person he knew , who seemed a little off , kill children ? " you know , " he began , " in the media , the person who does ( these ) things is seen as just evil . but i 've thought for a long time : what about the people who knew them ? what about the friends ? " he chews this over . " they knew them as a person . and now , being in that situation , it is very strange , " @entity71 said . " i knew this kid and there was no sign ever that he could hurt another person . " many people told @entity71 not to talk to reporters , but he just wants to talk . he wants information he might never get . " i want to know how this could happen . how ... a shy kid could do this .
