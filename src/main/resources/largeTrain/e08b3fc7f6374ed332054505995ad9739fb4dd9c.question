@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- embattled @entity1 leader @entity3 seemed increasingly cornered sunday as security forces defected to the opposition in a town near the capital and the @entity9 @entity8 voted for tough restrictions on and possible war crimes charges against the @entity1 regime . former security forces said they had switched sides and joined the opposition in @entity16 , a town about 55 kilometers ( 35 miles ) from the capital , @entity0 . some buildings in @entity16 showed signs of damage , including a freshly burned - out police station . @entity2 's @entity24 , on a government - organized trip to @entity16 , saw armed civilians taking defensive positions on rooftops to prepare for a possible effort by @entity3 loyalists to retake the town . about 2,000 people took part in an anti-government protest there , some standing atop tanks or holding anti-aircraft guns . they said they wanted the government overthrown , calling @entity3 a " bloodsucker . " later in the day , @entity2 witnessed two smaller pro-government rallies that had apparently been organized by government officials for international journalists to see , @entity24 reported . the opposition now controls several @entity1 cities after weeks of protests inspired by demonstrations that toppled longtime leaders in neighboring @entity48 and @entity49 . @entity3 criticized the @entity8 resolution sunday , telling private @entity52 station @entity53 by phone that council members " took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad . " he added , " if the @entity8 wants to know about something , they should have sent a fact - finding committee . " @entity62 secretary of state @entity61 said the @entity8 measures -- which include an arms embargo , asset freeze , and travel bans for @entity3 and members of his family and associates -- form " one of the speediest international responses to a government targeting its own people . " " we recognize the killings are ongoing , " @entity74 told reporters en route to a meeting of the @entity78 in @entity79 . " we recognize we need to advance the humanitarian , the military , judicial , and even forensic planning already under way . " @entity86 prime minister @entity85 and @entity86 foreign secretary @entity87 both called on @entity3 on sunday to go . " @entity1 's future has no future with him at the helm , " @entity85 said . " absolutely none . " @entity86 also announced it was freezing the assets of @entity3 , five of his children , and those acting on their behalf . @entity3 's son , @entity96 , denied the government used force on its own people . in an interview that ran sunday with @entity100 for @entity102 's " @entity101 , " he was asked about numerous reports of attacks by government forces on civilians . " show me a single attack , " he said . " show me a single bomb . show me a single casualty . the @entity1 air force destroyed just the ammunition sites . " the younger @entity3 -- who is a prominent member of the government -- also played down anti-government protests . just because " 10,000 or 5,000 people " demonstrate against his father , he said , does n't mean the entire population is against him . he had harsh words , however , for the @entity1 diplomats who have turned their backs on his father , calling them " hypocrites . " " if you are strong , they love you . if not , they say goodbye . that is good . we get rid of them , " he told @entity100 . meanwhile , @entity3 's nurse went home to @entity129 . @entity130 gained notoriety in november after @entity132 released a cable from the @entity134 in @entity0 describing @entity3 's almost obsessive reliance on the woman , described as a " voluptuous blonde . " @entity130 's daughter told @entity2 on sunday her mother had returned but was not commenting . tunisians on the border with @entity1 waved @entity142 - era @entity1 flags in support of the opposition as tens of thousands surged towards the country that triggered the series of @entity149 world revolts . about 100,000 people have fled violence in @entity1 in the past week , the @entity9 high commissioner for refugees said . @entity2 witnessed the @entity48 army , charities and ordinary @entity48 trying to help @entity1 on the border . refugees said @entity48 were offering them food , water , and even the use of phones . the @entity48 government reported saturday that 40,000 people had crossed its borders since february 20 , while @entity49 reported 55,000 had crossed over since february 19 , the @entity9 high commissioner for refugees said sunday . the evacuees include @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity1 , and many from @entity166 countries . about 10,000 fled from @entity1 to @entity48 on saturday , the @entity167 said . " very large numbers of people amassed in the @entity171 between @entity1 and @entity48 in extremely cold conditions , " @entity167 spokesman @entity168 told @entity2 on sunday . " people stood in the queue for six hours with no food , water , or access to sanitation . " the @entity167 is affiliated with the @entity167 and @entity167 . at least four people were carried away in stretchers because of crush injuries and several lost consciousness as a result of the chaos . " it was very worrying to see women passing their babies in cots over the crowd to keep them from harm , " @entity168 said . there were also chaotic scenes in @entity0 as people rushed to banks to claim a government handout of 500 dinars ( just over $ 400 ) per family . there were also long lines in @entity16 . pharmacies in @entity0 were running out of blood pressure and diabetes medicines , a source in the capital told @entity2 . @entity3 has showed no sign of relinquishing power . sunday , the world waited to see whether the threat of sanctions will have any effect on a country where the death toll from the recent unrest has topped 1,000 , according to an estimate from @entity9 @entity213 ban ki - moon . saturday night , the @entity9 @entity8 voted 15 - 0 on the draft resolution , which also refers the situation unfolding in @entity1 to the @entity216 . @entity3 and others could face an investigation for potential war crimes . " this resolution will be a signal ( to ) put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence , " said @entity220 , @entity1 ambassador to the @entity9 . earlier saturday , he renounced support for @entity3 , calling him " a leader who loves nobody but himself . " hours before the @entity8 's vote saturday , @entity1 's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader . @entity1 's deputy ambassador to the world body , @entity235 , indicated that he and fellow diplomats support " in principle " a caretaker administration under the direction of former justice minister @entity239 . city councils in areas no longer loyal to @entity3 chose @entity239 to head an interim government that would represent all of @entity1 and ultimately be based in @entity0 , according to @entity244 , a member of the coalition of the february 17 uprising , and a separate @entity1 opposition source . both are based in @entity250 , the eastern city that is under the control of the opposition . @entity239 was in @entity3 's government until monday , when he quit to protest the " bloody situation " and " use of excessive force " against unarmed protesters , according to @entity1 newspaper @entity258 . protests began february 15 in @entity250 , @entity1 's second largest city . at least several other cities are now thought to be under opposition control , according to eyewitnesses . there have been numerous reports of widespread violence -- some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and security forces loyal to @entity3 , and some by protesters . while @entity2 has staff in some cities , the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in @entity1 . @entity2 has also compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses . @entity2 's @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report .
