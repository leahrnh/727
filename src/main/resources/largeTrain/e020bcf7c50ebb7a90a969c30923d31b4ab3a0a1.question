@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- will it , or wo n't it , hold ? that 's the question following word late monday that @entity7 and @entity8 factions , including @entity9 , agreed to a 72 - hour humanitarian cease - fire proposed by @entity11 . even as they agreed to the cease - fire , set to take effect tuesday morning , both sides appeared suspicious of one another . " the onus is on @entity9 , " @entity7 government spokesman @entity16 said shortly after announcing on @entity1 's " the lead with @entity18 " that @entity7 had accepted the @entity11 proposal . under the agreement , the cease - fire will begin at 8 a.m. local time , he said . " we are entering this with our eyes open . ... we have been burnt more than once . " the sentiment was similar from @entity9 spokesman @entity28 , who told @entity1 as long as @entity7 honors the agreement , so will the @entity8 . " we hope they can take it and be committed to a cease - fire , " he said . while @entity11 has not released details of the cease - fire agreement , @entity16 said it was the same agreement that @entity7 accepted and @entity9 rejected three weeks ago . news of the cease - fire comes as @entity7 prime minister @entity39 vowed monday to finish the military operation to destroy @entity9 ' network of tunnels . that operation appeared to be close to an end , with @entity16 saying @entity7 will " cease all our ... military activities , all our offensive operations against terrorist targets in the @entity48 . " when asked about the tunnels , he said the issue is solving itself . " it 's winding up anyway , " @entity16 said . earlier in the day , the @entity52 said there were possibly between one and three tunnels left . mounting death toll both sides have been under fire for a mounting death toll in the conflict , now in its fourth week . more than 1,800 people have been killed in @entity0 , according to the @entity61 . the @entity63 has said of those casualties , civilians account for 70 % to 80 % . @entity7 officials have said 64 @entity7 soldiers and three civilians in @entity7 have died . the @entity68 urged both sides to honor the cease - fire agreement . " the @entity68 has been steadfast in our insistence on an end to rocket and tunnel attacks against @entity7 and an end to the suffering of the people of @entity0 , " @entity72 spokeswoman @entity71 said . on monday , during a short humanitarian " pause " in the fighting called by @entity7 , residents in @entity0 flooded the streets to pick up supplies and check on their abandoned homes . @entity87 , the largest open - air market in @entity0 , was bustling with vendors . one man hung clothes for sale from the burned - out carcass of a bus hit a few days ago by @entity7 fire power . cars jammed @entity0 's main thoroughfare , but the atmosphere appeared relaxed , and children played in the street . the @entity61 said at least 18 people were killed in @entity0 during the cease - fire , including an 8 - year - old in a strike on a house in a refugee camp in @entity0 . that strike also injured 30 people , @entity8 health officials said , and happened after @entity7 had started the cease - fire . @entity7 said that strike did not violate the cease - fire because it happened just two minutes into it and the operation had already been in progress . @entity9 had not agreed to the @entity7 - declared cease - fire , and at least 53 rockets were fired from @entity0 into @entity7 on monday , according to the @entity52 . @entity118 , a senior @entity119 operative in charge of intelligence - gathering in northern @entity0 , was targeted and killed before the cease - fire monday , the @entity52 said . he had participated in directing rocket attacks toward @entity7 , the @entity52 said . two attacks in @entity125 police in @entity125 said they foiled what they described as a terror attack when they shot and killed the driver of an earthmover after it overturned a passenger bus . police said one pedestrian was also killed and the bus driver was injured . there were no passengers on the bus at the time , police said . the driver of the earthmover was identified as 20 - year - old @entity139 , a @entity8 from the @entity125 neighborhood of @entity141 . footage broadcast by @entity7 's @entity143 showed the earthmover still moving as security forces approached . the video appeared to show shots being fired . the incident happened in the @entity150 area of central @entity125 , near the entrance to a @entity153 orthodox neighborhood . @entity9 praised the attack and said it was " a natural reaction to the @entity7 crimes against civilians " in @entity0 . in another incident , a man on a motorbike opened fire at an @entity7 soldier near @entity165 , @entity7 police spokesman @entity158 said . rescue workers said the @entity7 was severely wounded . an eyewitness on @entity168 said he heard a gunshot and saw " a soldier holding his chest . he walked a few steps backwards and collapsed . " international condemnation of @entity7 and @entity9 @entity174 is the latest country to condemn the @entity0 operation and strikes on @entity63 - run shelters in @entity0 . " how many deaths will it take to stop what has to be called the carnage in @entity0 ? " @entity174 foreign minister @entity182 asked in a statement . he said while @entity7 has a right to total security , " this right does not justify the killing of children and the slaughter of civilians . " he also said @entity9 carries an overwhelming responsibility in this " macabre gearing which particularly serves extremism . " on sunday , the @entity68 and the @entity63 used the strongest language yet in condemning the strike on a @entity63 - run shelter in @entity0 , with @entity197 calling the attack " disgraceful . " at least nine people at the school , which was being used as a shelter for about 3,000 people , were killed in the shelling . @entity7 said it is carefully reviewing the attack . the @entity52 said it targeted three @entity119 members riding a motorcycle in the vicinity of the school , but did n't say if the suspected militants were hit . @entity1 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this story

the operation to destroy @placeholder ' tunnels " is winding up , " the spokesman says
