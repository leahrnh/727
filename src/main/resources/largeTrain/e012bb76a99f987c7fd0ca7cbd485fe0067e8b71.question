@entity1 fighters stood saturday on the verge of taking not just a key @entity4 town along the @entity6 border , but also an entire province on @entity9 's doorstep -- spurring leaders of that province to urgently plead for @entity13 ground troops to halt the @entity16 extremist group 's rapid , relentless assault . the situation in @entity18 , just to the west of @entity9 , is " very bad , " said @entity20 , the president of @entity21 . @entity1 , the self - proclaimed " @entity23 " which also is referred to as @entity1 , controls about 80 % of the province . reports saturday suggest they have encircled @entity25 , the last large town in @entity18 province not yet in the militants ' hands . should all of @entity18 fall , the @entity31 extremists would rule from the perimeter of @entity35 's capital to @entity36 in @entity4 ( at least ) , according to the provincial council 's deputy head , @entity37 . to stave off @entity18 's collapse , provincial leaders have asked @entity35 's central government to intervene immediately and for @entity13 ground forces to be deployed there , said @entity37 . @entity35 army forces and @entity18 tribesmen fighting alongside them have threatened to abandon their weapons if the @entity13 military does not intervene to help them , he said , because they are faltering before the @entity1 onslaught . the army soldiers are not capable of defending themselves against @entity1 because of a lack of training and equipment , he said . already , some 1,800 tribesmen in the province have been killed or injured in the struggle . the @entity35 government has been adamant that it does not want @entity13 forces on the ground , and president @entity60 has not shown any intent to deploy any . the @entity35 government said it has not received any official request from @entity18 province for @entity13 military intervention and ground forces to help in the fight against @entity1 , prime minister @entity63 's media office said saturday . " if we receive any request , we will look into it and we will give our recommendation , but thus far we have not received any request , " the office said . a @entity13 defense official said saturday that @entity35 's government has n't asked for any more @entity13 troops beyond those already in @entity35 . and if they did , the official added , " the @entity13 will not deploy combat ground forces to @entity35 . and we remain focused on enabling the ( @entity35 military ) in the fight against @entity1 through our advise / assist efforts and the air campaign . " @entity13 defense secretary : @entity35 forces in ' full control ' of @entity9 the air campaign this official referred to resumed saturday . a coalition airstrike killed more than 30 suspected @entity1 militants who were part of an armed convoy heading toward the @entity95 military base west of @entity96 , said town police @entity97 . such airstrikes have been going on since august , a stretch in which @entity1 has expanded its reach . in @entity35 , the group appears to be targeting cities along the @entity105 . @entity20 said his provincial council has intelligence that @entity1 has dispatched as many as 10,000 fighters to @entity18 from @entity4 and @entity109 in northern @entity35 . @entity13 defense secretary @entity112 acknowledged the dire situation friday , telling reporters , " @entity18 province is in trouble . we know that . " a senior @entity13 defense official also told @entity118 that @entity35 forces are " up against the wall " in @entity18 . some units are in danger of being cut off by the advancing militants , who say they are members of @entity1 . the @entity35 ' ultimate goal is to take back some of the vast areas , in both @entity35 and @entity4 , that @entity1 controls . but right now , @entity35 forces appear to be mostly trying to survive , taking defensive positions and using @entity129 helicopters again , even after two were shot down in the area this week , according to the @entity13 official . but officals said @entity9 is not likely to be the next domino to fall . a @entity135 official said saturday there are " pockets " of the militant group 's fighters around the capital , but " no imminent threat of an effective @entity1 offensive . " @entity143 said saturday , while addressing reporters in @entity145 : " @entity35 security forces are in full control of @entity9 . " still , the equation could change if @entity1 threatens @entity9 airport , from which @entity13 @entity129 helicopters operate . retired @entity13 air force lt. col. @entity150 , a @entity118 military analyst , said : " i think at some point , there 's going to be the need for an additional ground force in western @entity35 . " those troops could be @entity13 or could be provided by other coalition nations , he said , but the @entity35 army , even after coalition airstrikes , has not been able to blunt the momentum of @entity1 . " the @entity35 army has virtually evaporated . the command structure does n't exist . although they have some good soldiers , they have no leadership . so , additional ground forces are going to be necessary . " warning of massacre in @entity4 border city of @entity169 in addition to its threats in @entity35 , @entity1 is a major and still advancing force in @entity4 , where it emerged during the years - long civil war there . its current focus there is @entity169 , a @entity177 enclave a stone 's throw from @entity6 . its fighters controlled about half that city on friday , significantly more than even a day earlier , the @entity180 reported . the @entity177 forces battling them early saturday repelled an attack on @entity185 in downtown , the @entity180 reported . the @entity188 - based monitoring group said @entity177 fighters killed 16 @entity1 fighters after targeting the bus they were riding in , which was packed with explosives and ammunition . the @entity177 killed another seven militants in another bus southwest of @entity169 , the group said . also saturday , @entity13 and allied warplanes hit a command and control facility , a staging building , a fighting position and two small units north of @entity169 as well as three @entity1 trucks south of it , according to @entity135 . " we are doing what we can do through our airstrikes to help drive back @entity1 , " @entity143 said . " in fact , there has been some progress in that area . but it is a very difficult problem . " an @entity212 fighter told @entity118 by phone saturday that he and others defending the besieged city , also known as @entity216 , are in desperate straits . @entity177 fighters from the @entity219 , or @entity219 , and @entity221 troops are vastly outnumbered and lack firepower , he said . the fighter estimated @entity1 forces are between 700 meters and 1 kilometer from the @entity225 border crossing ; should they take it , the militants would control three official border crossings between @entity6 and @entity4 and a 100 - kilometer border stretch . " we can not stop the @entity1 advance from the east because they have artillery , many fighters and a good supply of ammunition , " he said , adding that @entity219 and @entity221 fighters are worried because they are close to being encircled by @entity1 forces . inside @entity169 , a civilian told @entity118 that things are worse than ever ; the people are forced to endure mortar fire and fears of being beheaded should isis take over . the @entity243 special envoy for @entity4 , @entity244 , said such brutality may become a reality , warning that " the 12,000 civilians ... will be most likely massacred . " he added : " we know -- we have seen it -- what @entity1 is capable of doing when they take over a city ... with women , children , minorities and hostages . " oil and crime make @entity1 rich

there 's been " some progress " driving back @entity1 from @entity4 's @placeholder , @entity143 adds
