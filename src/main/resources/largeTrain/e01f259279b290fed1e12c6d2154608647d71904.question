( @entity0 ) -- luxury hotels and resorts conjure images of sunny skies , designer furnishings , lavish restaurants and the well - to - do milling about in grand fashion . but all that can change in rapid time , leaving decay and squalor in its place . war , weather , financial foul - ups and man - made catastrophes have all contributed to many of these former pleasure palaces being left to ruin . here are a few of the most celebrated empty hotels . 1 . @entity21 , @entity22 this sprawling almost - resort along the coast road on @entity21 , one of the @entity22 , is still shown on google maps even though it has never hosted a single guest . called the " @entity30 " by islanders , the project nearly bankrupted the tiny @entity32 nation . the 200 rooms were tiled , plumbed , wired and fitted with air - conditioning . some were carpeted and furnished -- but now the only residents are a few squatters and local gangs . construction began in the late 1980s but , when it was almost complete , the backers pulled out amid lurid allegations of misappropriated funds . location : @entity43 2 . @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ideally located on a secluded spit of land on the @entity46 island of @entity45 , the over-water bungalows here still appear alluring and the botanic garden - like grounds are still meticulously maintained . closer inspection reveals a totally derelict property , battered by the elements and stripped of all fittings , with gaping holes in the bungalow roofs and many of them in danger of collapse . it 's been a decade since the last guest checked out and the former @entity66 stands as a somber monument to the dramatic downturn in this onetime holiday paradise . location : @entity71 3 . @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 as the city of @entity73 appears to descend into a post-apocalyptic nightmare , so too many of the beleaguered metropolis 's great buildings are crumbling into dust . already the grand @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 hotels are gone , leaving this stately 1929 art - deco high - rise the sole unoccupied survivor of heritage status . closed for two decades , the @entity89 - designed 15 - floor structure is , however , deteriorating badly despite a preservation order and inclusion on the @entity92 . images from inside reveal its former grandeur and serve as a tragic indictment of this once great city 's spectacular fall from prominence . location : 2240 west @entity100 , @entity73 , @entity101 42 ° 21 ′ 34 ″ n 83 ° 6 ′ 6 ″ w 4 . @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 is this hotel the world 's greatest construction folly ? many say yes . begun in 1987 as a monument to @entity105 's eternal leader , @entity111 , what was conceived as an attempt to create the world 's tallest hotel has turned into the secretive stalinist state 's greatest visible embarrassment . just last april , the swank @entity119 chain back - peddled from its earlier management announcement that slated the 330 - meter , 3,000 - room , 105 - story monstrosity to open as early as 2014 . " ... [ m ] arket entry is not currently possible , " @entity119 told @entity0 . in september 2012 , the @entity105 state - owned tour company , @entity123 , released the first ever images from inside the very empty structure . location : @entity127 5 . @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 this historic hotel is a well - known landmark opposite the @entity133 on the waterfront at the @entity136 and @entity137 junction . it began as part of the @entity140 and , in 1979 , housed the first @entity142 government . the century - old @entity46 colonial style hotel is owned by the @entity144 -- or was . in a controversial transaction that broke the leaseholder 's contract , it was sold to a private development company with ties to the ruling party . @entity129 residents and other concerned persons launched a petition to save it from demolition , but its future remains uncertain . location : @entity158 6 . @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 the once flourishing resort district of @entity159 in the @entity161 city of @entity160 was once frequented by the likes of @entity165 and @entity166 . some regarded it as the most famous seaside resort in the world . when @entity171 invaded @entity161 in 1974 , @entity159 saw bloody fighting on its streets and , since partition of the island , the once hedonistic enclave is now a forbidden , fenced - off @entity177 . not one , but dozens of hotels are slowly falling apart as the urge to resettle this region has long diminished . the @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 are just some of the luxury hotels that will probably never see another guest . location : @entity189 7 . @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity74 if you 're driving out along the @entity193 in @entity191 , keep your eyes peeled for the bizarre @entity195 near @entity196 . at first glance you might think it was some forgotten @entity199 installation or spaceship , but it was started in the 1970s and contravened so many building codes it could n't ever be opened . it 's served variously as a souvenir stand and gas station over the years but is now all but derelict . open to vandals , wild animals and the savage @entity191 elements , enter at your own risk . location : @entity211 8 . @entity212 , @entity213 overlooking the stunning @entity215 on the @entity216 30 kilometers southwest of the @entity213 capital , this hotel sat empty and forlorn for two decades . scenic beauty regardless , the river powering the falls is one of the most polluted in the world and , coupled with the hotel 's " most haunted " reputation , soon put overnight guests off . the popularity of the falls for suicides also helped to doom this ornate little hotel . built as a mansion in 1928 for the @entity213 elite , it will never host another guest even if they did want to stay -- it 's become a @entity235 . location : @entity237 9 . @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 this then 10 - year - old , eight - storey hotel , along with the entire city of 50,000 residents , was hurriedly evacuated in april 1986 after the catastrophic explosion of the nearby @entity247 nuclear reactor . one of the tallest structures in the abandoned city , @entity248 serves as a prominent and sad reminder of that fateful day . the new wave of disaster tourists make a beeline for the building for a rooftop view over the desolate urban wasteland . the hotel , along with a ghostly amusement park , high school and stadium , make of @entity239 an altogether unsettling experience . location : @entity264 10 . unknown hotel , @entity266 , @entity267 just as many abandoned hotels are famous for their once lavish accouterments and celebrity guests , others are notable for their anonymity . this forlorn , riverside pension still has a couple of ground level occupants but is largely abandoned . clearly of @entity46 colonial origin , it probably dates from the 1920s or 1930s -- no definitive written or other record remains to confirm it . on the corner of @entity283 and @entity284 , who knows what stories these vacant walls and empty rooms could tell ? location : @entity290
