( @entity0 ) -- bagpipes are n't a sound one readily associates with @entity3 . yet along with the menacingly slow beat of a drum , they 're the soundtrack of one of the country 's more unusual historic tours . a small group , illuminated by gas lanterns , is standing at the foot of a medieval moat at the entrance to one of @entity18 's best - preserved medieval cities and a @entity19 -- the @entity20 in @entity21 . a guide dressed as one of the @entity24 is leading the tour , dredging up some of the island 's more sinister history , including how @entity28 used fallen bodies from his own army to cross the moat during the @entity32 . experiencing the ' new ' @entity3 perhaps even more surreal than this somewhat kitsch historical re-enactment is the fact that it was conceived by one of the island 's most exclusive resorts : @entity38 ( @entity21 ; +30 22440 35900 ; rooms from $ 213 ; @entity40 $ 203 per person ) . this year , the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading " @entity3 . " other excursions include a fishing expedition on a caique ( a traditional wooden fishing boat ) , beauty treatments performed with natural @entity51 products ( yogurt , honey and lemon ) and wine tastings from small vineyards in the surrounding @entity58 islands . @entity59 , the hotel 's managing director , says the idea came to her during the six - year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees . " the whole of @entity3 , it was like a small war , " she tells @entity0 . while many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all - inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- @entity59 decided to take the opposite approach . she launched " @entity3 " to get guests out of the hotel , and to promote sites that , though deserving , had remained under the radar for far too long . " i wanted to show that there was more to @entity3 than that , and more to @entity3 than feta cheese , " she says . " the crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking , and to get creative . before , we could be a bit arrogant . now , we have to be the best . " nothing to lose @entity59 is n't alone . throughout @entity3 , the recession is changing tourist offerings , giving them a new slant . " the crisis is the best thing that happened to me , " says @entity92 , founder of @entity93 ( +30 6948 405 242 ; tours from $ 60 per person ) . @entity92 worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010 . two years later , she launched her own tourism company . like @entity59 , she noticed that tour offerings in @entity102 had been stuck in a rut . " i looked around at what existed in @entity102 in terms of tourism and it was all very standard , very stereotypical , all ' ancient @entity102 ' , " she says . " there is so much more to @entity102 than just the ancient part . " it 's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it . so that was the concept . " in addition to its quirky walking tours ( among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the " enchanted forests " outside the city ) , the company pairs visitors with @entity102 gourmets , who host four - course supper clubs in their apartments . she now hosts two tours a day , attracting up to 25 visitors at a time . if it were n't for @entity3 's economic slump , she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture . " it was the kick in the butt i needed . i could either go back to the corporate world , which does n't have a future in @entity3 any more , or i could do this . " so i just jumped in and did it , because there was nothing i could lose . " beyond the package vacation there are many regions in @entity3 that package tour operators miss , regions that are only recently starting to find their voice . the island of @entity151 is a case in point . sure , it 's home to @entity155 , a bronze - aged settlement that lays claim to being one of @entity18 's oldest cities . it also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist 's heart aflutter and is where the @entity165 was uncovered . yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators , low - cost airlines and visitors alike . " we 're not that kind of destination . we have small family - run hotels that focus on service and quality rather than volume , " says @entity173 , who runs boutique travel agency @entity174 to @entity151 ( +30 22870 41008 ; packages from $ 40 per person per day ) . " we do n't have hotels where you can go in and sell , sell , sell . " that 's why tour operators do n't like us that much . we 're a headache . @entity173 started his company in 2011 after leaving a lucrative position at an insurance company to return to his home island . " the majority said , ' are you crazy ? you 're leaving a very good , well - paying job for something like this ? ' " @entity173 recognized that @entity151 had a lot to offer travelers : ancient thermal baths , underwater caves , an old pirate lair , third - century catacombs decorated with @entity202 murals . he also recognized that no one was talking up the island 's assets , or making them accessible . " it 's easy to go online and get a cheap room . it 's not easy to get in - depth knowledge of a destination . " if someone contacts us , we can tell them where to go , or which way the wind is blowing that day . " @entity173 supplies more than weather updates . his specialty is archeology and geological tours , which highlight some of the island 's incredible scenery . he 's also teamed up with other vendors on the island to offer a range of sailing and hiking expeditions . he recently introduced cooking lessons that showcase the island 's local cheese and produce . " as a young boy , i 'd remember seeing the odd , small @entity235 group walking around the island , but that was it . now , we have something more organized , we 're reaching more markets , and we 're seeing progress , " he says . other tours other examples of off - the - beaten path experiences abound , many introduced by local companies launched in the last few years . @entity246 @entity247 converted his family farm into an agro-tourism venture that includes a range of holistic activities , including yoga retreats , mountain biking , olive picking and wine making . @entity246 , @entity256 ; +30 21303 69814 ; see website for tours and prices @entity260 producing one of the few single - estate olive oils in @entity3 , this organic farm uses a traditional stone mill , and runs free tours of the grounds by appointment . visitors get a rare glimpse into the @entity271 olive oil tradition . @entity260 , @entity271 ; +30 2824 023281 @entity272 an organic farm on the southwest coat of @entity276 , @entity273 lies between the only cedar forest in the @entity278 and a @entity279 . visitors can eat at the organic restaurant on site , participate in farming activities , learn traditional methods of cooking ( the premises does n't use electricity ) or detox with the help of magnetic therapy . @entity273 , @entity276 ; +30 2661 076224 @entity291 housed in a 13th - century manor and surrounded by 18 acres of olive groves , vineyards and citrus trees , the @entity291 seems a slice of paradise . it opened its doors in 2010 , and has since introduced a range of exotic activities . guests can harvest the estate 's olives and grapes ( with their feet ) , try their hand at soap making , basket weaving or fishing , or can simply tour some of the nearby scenery , including the @entity313 era @entity314 . @entity291 , @entity315 : +30 27320 66300 ; rooms from $ 241 @entity317 among other culinary offerings , @entity271 is known for its snails . at the @entity317 , guests can go on a morning excursion through the mountains to gather the shelled creatures , which are later served for lunch or dinner . @entity317 , @entity271 ; +30 28310 58250/26213 ; from $ 241 for two nights , two people @entity328 located in one of the " blue zones " ( one of five areas in the world known for the exceptional longevity of the local population ) , the friendly , family - run @entity329 draws in guests with its affordable ( and perhaps life - lengthening ) cooking and wine courses . food and wine seminars last up to six days ( there 's accommodation on the premises ) , though those short of time can opt for a wine tasting ( served with snacks ) . @entity328 , @entity349 ; +30 22750 31151 ; six day courses from $ 400 per person @entity352 @entity352 , an eco-lodge in @entity271 , teams with @entity354 to offer five - and seven - day gastronomy workshops that focus on the island 's culinary traditions . guests even get to play beekeeper at a local honeybee farm . cooking lessons are broken up by nature hikes , beach bumming and a vineyard tour . @entity365 , @entity271 ; +30 28210 46774 ; cooking workshops from $ 127
