( @entity0 ) -- a room with a view is a perk usually coveted by travelers . so much so that one of the most famous travel romance movies of all time takes that title . but travel is also about shutting the rest of the world out , and nothing does that quite like a room without even a single window to the outside world . here we look at a variety of viewless accommodations , from rock - carved former monastery chambers to cave camping @entity20 - style . @entity22 di @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 shutting out the world is an ancient tradition at @entity25 's @entity28 , which pays homage to the baths , or thermae , of the @entity32 . the spa complex , carved out of limestone rock thousands of years ago , re-creates this popular imperial pastime , with stages of water treatments , from the anti-tepidarium with its carved @entity40 head to the tepidarium , hydromassage and caldarium , all meant to reduce stress and remove impurities from the body . 7 amazing island rentals rooms at the @entity28 , in the southern town of @entity24 , are a mix of caves , grottos and stone structures , wonderfully silent retreats whether you use the spa or not . ( but why would n't you ? ) @entity24 , in the arch of the boot of @entity25 , is one of the world 's oldest continually inhabited cities . for thousands of years , citizens have lived in the hillside city , its historical ' @entity63 ' ( or center ) made of houses and caves carved into the tufa limestone . visitors to the @entity72 will find themselves wandering amid @entity73 , @entity75 and @entity76 periods of @entity25 's history . rates start at about $ 120 for a double room . @entity80 , @entity24 , @entity25 @entity24 is home to a wealth of underground structures and accommodations . another choice for a beautiful room without a view is @entity80 , known locally as an ' albergo diffuso , ' or diffused hotel , due to its scattered locations within a complex . also located in the @entity63 , a @entity91 , the @entity80 has rooms with simple stone arches , their interiors lit in such a way that the tufa limestone takes on a warm honey - like glow . flower - filled patios are part of the charming lodging experience , where breakfast and other meals are served splashed in @entity25 sunlight . @entity105 : @entity106 @entity107 , of @entity109 travel agency , works with the hotel and also recommends visitors see the nearby @entity112 . though you ca n't stay in them , " they keep many secrets " and her tours through the more than 1 kilometer of tunnels include underground churches , bas - relief decorations and rooms that might have been used by free masons . rates starting from about $ 265 . @entity123 @entity124 , @entity125 for a more rugged cave sleeping adventure , try the @entity127 . billing itself as " the world 's largest , deepest , darkest motel room , " the underground accommodation is tucked away 220 feet below ground , shaped by millions of years of history . the @entity134 added another chapter to the caverns ' long story when in 1962 , during the @entity139 , president @entity138 made the 65 - million - year old caves into a bomb shelter stocked for 2,000 people to survive for more than a month . today , visitors can stay in the @entity144 , which is part of a 48 - room no - frills motel . the suite consists of a platform in a hulking limestone cave outfitted with beds , a living area and bathroom . it 's so deep underground and devoid of natural light that nothing lives in the caverns , not even a bat or a mouse . the largest dry cavern in the @entity161 , the air is filtered and virtually moisture - free due to the limestone setting . this unique sleeping arrangement does n't come cheap : the @entity144 is $ 700 a night as a double , $ 100 for each extra person . ( 928 ) 422 - 4565 @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 @entity167 seems to specialize in this kind of accommodation , and one of the most interesting underground dwellings is @entity165 in @entity166 . this 53 - guest room hilltop hotel complex is built into a series of caves , underground tunnels and other ancient structures once used by monks and early @entity178 . some of the underground rooms are outfitted with ethereal cave pools , and there are above ground options if you 're claustrophobic . the whole area looks like something out of a fairy tale with unusual chimney rock formations making sharp peaks over short bases that might remind you of the @entity191 , if the @entity192 had turned them to stone . more than five kilometers of caves and underground tunnels lead through @entity197 , where the hotel is located . with a vineyard on the hotel grounds , there 's never a shortage of wine for guests lounging underground . doubles from about $ 240 for basic rooms to about $ 1,802 for a special room with its own pool , with discounts available for early booking or multiple night stays . @entity212 @entity213 , @entity214 imagine a giant underground living room complete with its own crystal chandelier . that 's what you 'll find at @entity213 . the chandelier is an elegant touch to an otherwise primitive underground experience . up to 250 people can camp inside the caves , bringing their own equipment or using air mattresses and other items management can provide . bathrooms , a snack bar and other amenities mean you wo n't be completely roughing it . overnighting in the cave starts at $ 40 per person and includes a tour and breakfast . the giant caverns were discovered in 1810 by surveyor @entity237 who wandered into them , getting lost for days when the torch he was carrying went out . today , campers and explorers can find such enormous spaces as @entity243 , @entity245 's @entity244 , @entity246 , @entity247 and the @entity248 , all part of a complex that stretches for more than 30 miles underground . many people come for the day , exploring and staying above ground nearby . or make it an event with the once a month @entity256 concerts , recorded for a local radio station and seen on @entity258 . no matter the season , the @entity213 are a cool , year - round 56 degrees . @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 some places are literally underground jewels , and that 's the case with the @entity260 in @entity261 , the opal mining capital of the world . it is so hot in the @entity269 that many people retreat underground , and the town has underground shopping , dining and accommodation complexes -- even subterranean churches . the @entity260 was specially built to mimic this local way of living under the ground , its walls chiseled out of the sandstone . located just off the @entity281 , @entity261 might not be as familiar as other popular @entity269 locations , but that does n't mean you have n't come across it . the town was one of the locations for the @entity290 - winning @entity269 movie " @entity291 .
