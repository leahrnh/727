" the cancellation of ' @entity5 ' sends the strong message that using animals for cheap laughs on tv shows is archaic and uninteresting to today 's viewers , who are sophisticated enough to know that not only is putting a monkey in a lab coat not funny , it 's also cruel . " @entity2 cancels ' @entity5 ' yes , thank goodness that @entity22 , the most pampered monkey on the planet , has been rescued from employment with a cast of comic actors in @entity28 ( on a series that , if anything , idolized the animal kingdom ) . @entity2 is replacing " @entity5 " next month with the return of sitcom " @entity34 .
