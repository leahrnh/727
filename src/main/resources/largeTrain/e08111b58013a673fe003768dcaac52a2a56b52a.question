" " my agent called me one night ... i had just put [ son ] @entity13 to bed . it was like 9 o'clock at night , and i always get grumpy with them when they call me really late , " she told @entity2 . " they said , ' @entity18 would like to fly you to @entity0 tomorrow . will you get on a plane to come and meet for ' @entity10 ' ? and i said i ca n't come tomorrow , but i can come the next day . " the flight turned out to be well worth it -- though @entity23 said she was discombobulated by the speed of it all . " i went and met with [ director ] louis [ @entity28 ] and they offered me the part that day , " she said .
