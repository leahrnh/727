@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- a dog 's life is fairly easy . it usually involves waking up late , eating some food and then passing out for eight hours in the backyard . i 've tried it a few times , myself . was n't disappointed . the rest of a dog 's day is generally spent whizzing on various plants and mindlessly staring at things that pass by the house . again , i 've dabbled in the lifestyle . and i approve . but there 's this one dog in @entity0 , @entity1 , who just seems to have it better than most . and i recently got to meet her . i first learned of @entity21 when i saw a popular picture of her on the website @entity24 . it was posted in a section called " aww " that is dedicated to all things cute and adorable -- puppies , bunnies , @entity31 doing @entity31 things in @entity31 . the photo showed @entity34 staring out from under a gate , and the title read : waiting for his family to return in @entity0 , @entity1 [ @entity39 ] . it got dozens of comments . in @entity24 parlance , [ @entity39 ] means @entity43 , which is to say the individual who posted the image actually created it . this was helpful when it came to tracking down the whereabouts of this dog ( who we now know is actually a female ) . you see , i was going to @entity0 over @entity56 and was looking for a pointless adventure -- something that would take me to a particular part of town i may not have otherwise seen . and i figured trying to find this dog from @entity24 was as good enough an adventure as any . so , i messaged the guy who took the photograph and learned that his name is @entity66 , 31 , of @entity67 , @entity68 . @entity66 and his girlfriend , @entity69 , were driving home from vacation and decided to stop and spend the night in @entity0 . while wandering around the historic neighborhoods near the battery , @entity66 stumbled upon @entity34 . " he seemed like the kind of dog quite used to this routine , " @entity66 wrote me . " but not anxious about his family returning . just slightly forlorn . " @entity66 did n't know the exact location of the house , but he sent me a link to an approximate street view on @entity83 . eventually , i sorted out the actual address on my own , thus exhausting my brain 's entire lifetime supply of deductive reasoning . i treated myself to a nap . finally , on the saturday after @entity56 , i walked up to @entity34 's house and knocked on the old door leading into the courtyard . mind you , this kind of bold , unsolicited introduction is the kind of thing you can do when you 're a serious journalist hoping to write a fluff piece on somebody 's dog . otherwise , it 's sort of creepy . though , to be fair , even with my @entity2 business card in hand , it was still probably kind of creepy . i 'm a mouth breather . nevertheless , @entity104 politely greeted me at the door along with @entity34 , who was carrying a boot in her mouth . it was @entity104 's boot . which is to say , it was now @entity34 's . her official name is @entity114 re. in @entity115 that translates to @entity21 . i learned she was actually born on @entity116 2002 , just around the corner from @entity104 's home . this year she turns 11 . and speaking of 11 , that was the exact number of yellow lab puppies in her litter . @entity34 was the runt . @entity104 's daughter , @entity123 , was friends with one of the children who lived around the corner from where @entity34 was born . the mother of the friend called up @entity104 's wife and said , " i hate to tell you this , but @entity123 's fallen in love with one of our puppies . " @entity104 says , " we knew our goose was cooked . " and right as he told me this , just like clockwork , @entity123 suddenly emerged through the courtyard door , returning from a jog . @entity123 , a history student at the @entity144 , remembers first meeting @entity34 , and that most of the puppies were named after characters from the hit tv show , " friends . " which , sadly , means somebody out there has a dog named @entity154 . but when the breeders ran out of " friends " characters , they started using @entity160 names . @entity34 , being the runt , was originally called @entity162 . and names are important . if you 've ever adopted a dog you know how influential they can be . my dog is @entity168 , and when i first found him online and saw his name , i figured it was a sign . i 'm a big fan of the band @entity170 , and their late guitarist also went by @entity168 . clearly , it was meant to be . of course , @entity168 ( my dog ) was also really cute . so , at the time , i pretty much could 've justified any name . " this is polio . " " i 'll take him . " but @entity34 seems to fit this particular dog quite nicely , and these days she spends most of her time in the courtyard of the historic 200 - year - old house , looking out at tourists walking down the street . it 's pretty much her job . and , though she only recently earned a bit of internet fame on @entity24 , it 's certainly not the first time @entity34 has come under the lens . @entity104 says , " literally almost every day i see somebody taking a picture of her with her nose under the gate . " in the @entity195 neighborhood of @entity0 , @entity34 is sort of a big deal . everybody knows her , and she 's an important member of the community . in fact , @entity34 recently escaped from the yard during the annual @entity201 , and , just like a local , simply joined all the joggers running down @entity203 . another time , she got out of the yard and spent the entire day riding around in a pedicab . " the guy had her in the back and was trying to figure out where she belonged , " @entity123 remembers . " i do n't think she wanted to come back . she made a friend . " @entity104 chimes in , " @entity34 likes all dogs and most people . " just do n't take her boot . follow @ @entity213 on @entity214 .

@entity219 set out to find this dog in @placeholder , @entity1
