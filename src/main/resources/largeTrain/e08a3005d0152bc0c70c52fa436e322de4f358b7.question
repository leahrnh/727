@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- president @entity3 was sworn in sunday after the @entity4 declared he overwhelmingly won the country 's disputed runoff election . " i , @entity3 , do swear that i will well and truly serve @entity1 in the office of president , so help me @entity13 , " @entity3 said at the @entity8 complex in @entity0 , standing before a red - robed judge wearing a white wig . his words were met with loud applause . the international community has roundly called the election -- allegedly marred by violence and vote rigging -- a " sham . " many voters expressed fear of government retaliation if they did not take part in the vote to extend @entity3 's rule . some said they were required to report the serial numbers on their ballots to @entity3 's @entity28 -- @entity29 . watch as @entity3 gets sworn in Â» @entity1 's @entity4 released the final results of friday 's runoff vote , showing that @entity3 won by an almost 9 - to - 1 margin , with voter turnout about 42 percent . the final tally , according to the electoral commission , showed @entity3 snaring 2.2 million votes , or about 86 percent of the ballots , to opposition candidate @entity38 's 233,000 . the commission 's quick turnaround was a contrast to the five weeks it took the @entity4 to release results from the march 29 election . @entity38 's @entity45 quickly denounced the results , calling the election " a one - man race , a one - man circus . " " we have nothing to do with the so - called @entity3 win , " @entity45 spokesman @entity56 " in effect we believe that whatever @entity51 and @entity3 are doing is just but a continuation of the sham . " he added , " we do not in any way associate ourselves with the so - called win . " a government official confirmed earlier sunday that invitations had been sent out for @entity3 's inauguration , but said the ceremony would not be held until official results were announced and a winner declared . a @entity1 journalist said there was activity at the presidential residence saturday night . tents were erected and trucks drove in and out of the property , leading reporters to speculate that a swearing - in ceremony was in the works . @entity38 was among those invited to the ceremony , but he would not attend , @entity56 said before the ceremony . " how do you invite a man to a false wedding ? " he asked . @entity3 was the sole candidate in the runoff . @entity38 pulled out last week , citing violence and intimidation , but the government said it was too late to remove his name from the ballots . before the results were official , @entity3 said he won in all parts of the capital city of @entity0 and many parts elsewhere . though there were reports friday of low voter turnout , the state - run newspaper lauded record turnout , and @entity3 said he did not know what prompted people to vote in such overwhelming numbers . @entity3 made the claims sunday at a funeral for his wife 's relative . it was broadcast on state television . " @entity108 was very low , " @entity106 , executive director of @entity107 , said sunday . " a lot of people [ were ] dragged to the polling station to fill out a ballot paper . " the @entity45 reported that @entity51 supporters herded rural voters to the polls and forced them to vote . the party said about 90 of its supporters have been killed in the weeks preceding the election . @entity1 deputy minister of information @entity119 said he would not " dignify the charges with comment " and declared the voting process peaceful . he also said @entity45 supporters burned down some polling stations . members of the @entity128 observer mission , however , said the election was not " free , fair and credible . " " the environment was tense , hostile and volatile , " said @entity130 , a lawmaker from @entity131 . " and there was a high level of intimidation , violence , displacement of people , abduction and loss of lives . " the mission said opposition parties were not allowed to hold rallies and were shut out from broadcasting their campaign messages on state - run media . " there was hate speech , incitement of violence and war rhetoric that instilled fear and trepidation amongst voters , " @entity130 said . @entity155 prime minister @entity154 called on the @entity156 to send troops to @entity1 , saying the ongoing crisis in the country is a " shame and embarrassment . " @entity154 , a former opposition leader who became @entity155 's prime minister after a power - sharing deal following a disputed election in that country , made the comments during a visit to his home province . he made a similar appeal earlier this month . " the information that we have right now is that @entity3 is proceeding with impunity , completely disregarding the world opinion , " he said . " and i have suggested that the @entity174 should support the @entity156 and come up with a peacekeeping force that will be deployed in @entity1 so that some calmer decisions can be facilitated . " opposition leaders and international observers have called the election a " sham " -- a word that president @entity181 also used to denounce the voting . tsvangirai supporters say he defeated @entity1 's longtime leader in the march elections . but when the results were reported , the @entity3 - appointed commission said @entity38 had not won by enough to avoid a runoff . @entity3 has been the country 's only leader since it gained its independence from @entity192 in 1980 . @entity38 remained holed up for a sixth day saturday at the @entity193 in @entity0 , @entity56 said . @entity38 fled to the embassy last week , saying he feared for his safety . matonga on saturday said that the government would be willing to sit down with @entity38 and @entity45 members " as long as they are not pushing the @entity192 agenda or an @entity202 agenda . " @entity3 has called the @entity45 a creation of the @entity204 . however , @entity205 , @entity45 secretary - general , said saturday that the runoff had closed some doors in the eyes of the @entity45 . " a government of national unity , as far as we 're concerned , is history , " he said , saying that some sort of transitional arrangement might be possible .
