@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- it 's been five years since @entity3 journeyed to @entity4 in search of true love on the series finale of " @entity8 . " she appeared to have found it in the arms of @entity11 , and she returned to @entity0 -- and her now - settled friends -- ready for a new start . @entity14 was a driving force in creating the " @entity8 " movie . then came the inevitable cry : that 's it ? what happens next ? @entity14 , who played @entity3 , wanted to find out as well . but the situation had to be right , she said , which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together , fell apart and came together again . now that the movie is out , @entity26 -- who 's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big - screen " @entity8 " with " @entity33 " anchor @entity32 . the following is an edited version of that interview . @entity1 : i think a lot of fans , maybe a lot of people , and those of you among the cast , did n't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are . so how are you feeling deep inside , @entity14 ? @entity14 : i feel extraordinarily privileged . i 've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together . ... it 's a once - in - a - lifetime kind of professional experience and one really should n't be greedy enough to ask for it twice . watch the cast talk about the thrill of " @entity8 " » i have to say that , this last six , eight months , was better than those seven years [ the show aired ] and i think it 's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you do n't get to tell twice . it has been , i must say , worth every obstacle and dead end , and fit and start , and every moment that was seemingly impossible . it has been a dream . @entity1 : and i imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read , which was , from my understanding , the first time you all actually were in the same room [ together ] regardless of how much you kept in touch . tell me a little bit about that moment . @entity26 : i started putting [ the ] script back together in april of 2006 ... and that [ table read ] was a really extraordinary day , because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated . @entity81 [ @entity82 ] had been away and @entity83 [ @entity84 ] had been away and @entity85 [ @entity86 ] had been [ doing ] his other job , and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more . it was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours . ... it was a kind of reunion that is very , very special , because you really want to be there . it 's not the reunion where you 're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely . it 's the reunion that you want . i think even more so was that first day on [ the ] set . when we thought , good @entity108 , [ writer / director ] @entity109 [ @entity111 ] and i are actually making this movie , like we got it done , we 're here , we 're doing it -- what a privilege . @entity1 : i think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on " @entity123 , " because the energy was ... palpable . ... but we 're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project . ( rumors have abounded about friction between the stars . ) one of my producers said while we were watching the tv , " are they going to sit near each other ? " " why are they putting @entity85 in the middle of all of them ? " hearing that , does it make you mad ? @entity26 : i find it slightly -- it 's not that i 'm mad . i expect better from people . i think it 's really beneath me , to keep defending myself . i have a 35 - year career . i have an impeccable character , i really pride myself in my work ethic and the way i treat people . and i think @entity81 would say the same and @entity148 would say the same . and i love @entity81 , and i wanted her to be in this movie . we could n't have done it without her , we could n't have done it without @entity83 , we could n't have done it without @entity148 [ @entity155 ] , nor could we have done it without @entity85 . watch @entity82 address the rumors » you know , this is a story that people like to tell about women . why ? i do n't know . is it that interesting ? probably not . so once again i just have to say it does n't define the experience . nobody can take the experience away . it 's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale . @entity1 : you seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to , being at the game as long as you 've been . to that end , one of the things that i 've always admired about you and [ husband ] @entity183 [ @entity184 ] and i think a lot of people do , is how you 've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight . ... now i know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you do n't talk about your private lives , which is great and i applaud that . that said , is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that ? @entity26 : i would n't make any proclamations about why i have a marriage that , to me , is successful . i would just say that we 've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people . this is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia , and the movie industry fits into it in some small way , but there are a lot of people of important interest and i think that it 's a conscious choice to live in a place where we 're bumping up against humanity . we run to the market on our own , we take the subway , and we integrate into our city , and we become a part of the fabric and i think it 's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son . does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we do n't have paparazzi every single day at our house ? no , but it is a city where you ca n't live behind a gate , you ca n't drive up in a car and be protected . you walk out the door and it is what it is . so you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can . @entity1 : is it the end of " @entity8 " ? what does your gut tell you ? @entity26 : my gut tells me it 's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up . the future is dictated not by us at this point , and i think @entity109 and i have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen , that we have n't thought about the future . doing this was more than we could have asked for . so anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way .
