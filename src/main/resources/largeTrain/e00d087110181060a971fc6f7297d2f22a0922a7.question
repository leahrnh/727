after killing a man at an @entity2 , police interrogated his girlfriend , accusing her of lying , threatening her with jail time and suggesting she could be on drugs , according to a video obtained by @entity7 . the man , @entity8 , was holding an air rifle he had picked up off a store shelf when police shot him . a prosecutor called the case a " perfect storm " with " no bad guys , " but the family has said police used excessive force . a grand jury decided not to indict the officer who pulled the trigger in the august 5 shooting at a @entity2 store in @entity24 , @entity2 . while the @entity25 investigates the case , @entity8 's name -- along with @entity28 and @entity29 -- is being chanted by some demonstrators across the country protesting what they say is systemic racism that fuels police violence . now , the family 's lawyer says the recently released interrogation video shows police were trying to force @entity8 's girlfriend to say something to justify what they 'd done . " this was just an effort to cover up this bad shooting , " attorney @entity44 said . family of man killed sues police , @entity2 tense interrogation in the interrogation video , which was first posted on @entity55 's website on sunday , a police detective repeatedly presses @entity8 's tearful girlfriend , asking her where @entity8 got the gun he had in the store . " you understand that we 're investigating a serious incident , " detective @entity59 says . " you lie to me and you might be on your way to jail . " " i swear to @entity68 , on my job , my family , on everything i love , " @entity65 replies , telling the detective repeatedly that she never saw @entity8 with a weapon and that she 'll take a polygraph test to prove it . as she cries , the detective appears unconvinced . " why would he have a gun in the store ? " he asks . " i do n't know , " she replies . " did he carry a gun ? " the detective continues . " not that i. ... i 've never known him to have a gun , " she says . her response appears to upset the detective . " do n't tell me , ' not that you know , ' because that 's the first thing that i realize that somebody 's not telling me the truth , when they say that kind of stuff , " @entity59 says . at one point in the video , @entity89 sobs as she buries her head in her hands . the detective says he 'll write down her testimony but then asks whether she 's under the influence of drugs or alcohol . " your eyes are kind of messed up looking and you seem a little lethargic at times , " he says , " and i do n't know if it 's because you 're upset or not . i just want to make sure what 's going on . " it 's not until the end of the 90 - minute interrogation that @entity89 learns her boyfriend has died . " well , to let you know , @entity8 has passed away as a result of this , " the detective says . @entity89 sinks back in her chair and puts her hands on her head . " i do n't know any other way to tell you , " @entity59 says . " what happened there was n't a good thing and as a result of his actions , he is gone . " detective : ' i was very direct in my questions ' police have not responded to several requests from @entity7 for comment on the video . in a statement officials released in september , @entity59 describes his questioning of @entity89 at the police department . " the initial information i had was that ( @entity8 ) may have brought a gun into the store with him . so i was very direct in my questions that i was having problems believing she would have not seen him bring a gun into the store , " he wrote . " she became emotional during the interview and started crying , saying that she is not lying , she will take a lie detector test and do whatever she needs to do . " in his report , @entity59 wrote that it was only later when he was at the @entity2 that he learned where the gun came from . " i also learned while on scene that the rifle involved was a pellet gun that was taken from a box while he was inside the store , " he wrote . " this would also agree with the statement that she made that he did not take any type of firearm out of her car into the store with him . " attorney : interrogation shows police ' tried to cover it up ' @entity44 on tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers ; @entity24 's police chief ; the city of @entity24 and its police department ; and @entity2 . the @entity8 family is seeking at least $ 75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages , the suit said . the family alleges , among other things , that the police officers did not do due diligence to determine that @entity44 was n't a threat ; that the officers did n't give him enough time to put down the weapon ; and that @entity2 was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf , unpackaged , for at least two days , the family 's lawyers said tuesday . @entity44 said police knew @entity8 did n't have a firearm when he walked into the @entity2 . " he was not an imminent threat to anyone . he was just shopping , " he said . after the grand jury decided in september not to indict the police officers who were involved in the shooting , prosecutor @entity189 said a " perfect storm of circumstances " led to @entity8 's death and noted that the air gun bore a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon . " it is very hard to tell the difference , " @entity189 said . police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that @entity8 was walking around with a rifle and " waving it back and forth . " according to police , when officers arrived , @entity8 did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon . and the @entity8 family 's lawyers say police did n't give him enough time to put down the weapon . but @entity44 said that because @entity8 was black , police made assumptions . " the officers ran into an aisle , saw a black man with what they perceived to be a gun , and shot him on sight , " he said . the interrogation video , he said , shows how police handled the case from day one . " they , in their mind , had it made up that mr. @entity8 was a criminal , and they proceeded based on that without doing anything to independently corroborate what was actually happening in the store , " he said . " and they tried to cover it up by interrogating miss @entity65 in such a manner to try to get her to make a statement that would justify them shooting and killing mr. @entity8 that evening . " opinion : killing of @entity8 -- injustice for all
