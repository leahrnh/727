( @entity0 ) -- at the @entity4 summit in @entity7 , president @entity1 and leaders of @entity5 's @entity4 allies agreed on an " irreversible " plan to withdraw from @entity9 . but challenges remain . despite the deliberately unambiguous word choice used to describe the withdrawal , uncertainty about how the @entity14 will confront the obstacles ahead remains . issues specifically related to @entity9 are yet to be resolved , and plenty of others are tied to the volatile politics of the area . the @entity21 is already taking the lead in regions with roughly 75 % of the population , with @entity5 and other @entity4 troops acting as support . however , this does not include the most contested areas in the south and east , where @entity9 forces are slated to assume responsibility by next summer . serious doubts persist about their readiness to do so . despite significant training efforts , the army 's level of competence remains in question . it lacks many of the support functions needed for war fighting . the army will remain dependent on international forces for these capabilities and on the international community for financial assistance , expected to cost at least $ 4 billion a year . the strategic partnership agreement signed by the @entity5 and @entity9 in early may addressed both issues . @entity50 pledged a residual force of @entity5 troops that will stay in @entity9 and promised financial assistance . still unclear , however , is how many soldiers will make up the residual force , how long they will stay , what their main objectives will be and where they will be based . complicating matters even more , the @entity9 army is overwhelmingly non-pashtun , which makes operating in the overwhelmingly @entity61 south and east , where the @entity63 - led insurgency is strongest , all the more challenging . the army 's ethnic composition and that of the @entity69 government are also among @entity71 's chief concerns . which brings us to the wider regional concerns . during the 1990s , @entity71 's rival @entity75 supported the @entity77 against the @entity71 - sponsored @entity63 . today , @entity71 views the @entity79 army in @entity9 as essentially the @entity77 on steroids : a 300,000 - plus force equipped by the @entity5 and , like the government in @entity83 , partial to @entity75 . if the @entity9 army holds together , then @entity71 faces an unfriendly army loyal to an unfriendly government on its western border . if the army splinters as a result of its unbalanced ethnic composition -- @entity61 represent the majority of the population but a small minority in the army -- this probably would result in inter- and intra-ethnic violence that could rend the nation . a civil war in @entity9 would have disastrous consequences for the region , particularly neighboring @entity71 . yet @entity71 's fears have led it to pursue a myopic policy that could contribute to this very outcome . it supports the @entity63 , the @entity104 and other assorted proxies in @entity9 both as a hedging strategy and with the aim of positioning itself as the ultimate arbiter of any resolution . this has encouraged hedging among other regional actors and led to @entity71 's isolation . though the @entity71 security establishment supports an @entity9 - led reconciliation with the @entity63 , it seeks significant control over that process . this is unacceptable to @entity83 , @entity50 and , ironically , the @entity63 . they all want to minimize @entity71 's role . these thorny issues have been extant for quite some time , but no clear path to resolving them has been proposed , and it does n't appear any significant progress was made in @entity7 . the main focus on @entity71 during the @entity4 summit concerned its willingness to reopen @entity4 supply lines into @entity9 that have been closed since november after a @entity5 air raid accidentally killed 24 @entity71 soldiers . since then , supplies have been shipped via the longer and more expensive @entity135 running through @entity136 and @entity137 . although reopening @entity71 supply lines is not essential for maintaining @entity4 forces on the ground , they constitute an important logistical link for any large - scale withdrawal . when @entity71 president @entity145 received a last - minute invite to @entity7 , it was well understood that this was intended to ease @entity71 's resistance to reopening these supply lines . but they remain closed , subject to a disagreement over the transit fee @entity71 will receive for each truck and @entity50 's unwillingness to issue a formal apology for the air raid . most experts anticipate that the issue will be resolved sooner rather than later . more troubling , @entity71 's presence in @entity7 was tied mainly to its control of supply lines , not to the vital role it could play in tipping the balance in @entity9 toward either a political resolution or a possible civil war . meanwhile , the @entity71 military appears to be increasing support for its own proxies in anticipation of the @entity4 drawdown , heightening the possibility of civil war in @entity9 . that other regional powers , chiefly @entity75 and @entity173 , are readying their own proxies for this eventuality only risks making it more likely . questions remain about whether any residual @entity5 force will be sufficient to provide enough support to the @entity9 army to avoid such an outcome . it 's also unknown whether this objective will take priority over strategically defeating @entity185 or at least denying it the ability to reclaim its safe haven in @entity9 . the summit in @entity7 was an important turning point . @entity5 forces can not remain in @entity9 at present levels indefinitely , not least because there is no purely military solution to these problems . but it 's clear that a timeline for the transition to a new role for the @entity5 and @entity4 allies in @entity9 does not mean the war is over . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .
