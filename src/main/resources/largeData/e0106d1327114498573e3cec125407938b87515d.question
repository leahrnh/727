( @entity0 ) -- a former @entity2 footballer is one of six players who have reportedly been arrested in the latest fixing scandal to hit the sport . second division team @entity6 confirmed monday that striker @entity7 had been taken into custody by police as part of an undercover investigation into claims that the players accepted bribes to ensure certain outcomes during a match -- known as spot - fixing -- for betting purposes . " following reports in today 's national media , @entity6 can confirm that striker @entity7 has been arrested , " @entity6 , which has won the @entity20 title three times , said in a statement . " the club will be making no further comment on what is now an ongoing legal matter . " @entity7 came to prominence in 2006 when he was signed by @entity2 side @entity31 , having spent most of his career in non-league football . his time in the top flight was limited as @entity31 was relegated that season , but he helped the club win promotion again before being sold to second division @entity38 and then returning to the @entity2 with @entity39 . @entity0 has attempted to contact @entity7 but is awaiting a response . the arrests were first reported by the @entity43 's @entity42 on sunday newspaper , which focused on what appear to be claims by former @entity48 international @entity47 , who was recorded on video published by the @entity42 saying he could arrange for players to receive yellow cards for offenses during a match . on the video published by the @entity42 , @entity47 appears to admit he purposefully got himself thrown out of a game by hitting the opposing team 's player , while in action for his former club @entity58 against @entity59 in a third division match in february . authorities have not confirmed @entity47 is one of the players arrested . @entity0 has attempted to reach @entity47 for comment , but has n't yet reached him . @entity47 , who was released by @entity58 at the end of last season , twice punched an opposition player in the groin before being ordered off the pitch . the @entity42 on sunday reported that @entity47 claimed on hidden camera that he received Â £ 70,000 ( $ 114,000 ) for doing so . he also appears to claim in the @entity42 's hidden video footage that he could influence the outcome of @entity2 matches , and that he was targeting the @entity73 in @entity74 . " that 'll be the one , the @entity73 , " @entity47 said in the video , according to the @entity42 on sunday . " we 'll do a whole game , get booked once , big money . if you pay a hundred grand it will be huge . " @entity58 , now playing in @entity20 's bottom division , said it is " extremely shocked and saddened " by the allegations . " match - fixing of any type goes to the heart of the integrity of the game , " said spokesman @entity86 . " the player in question no longer plays for the club and we have not been contacted by the authorities , but of course we would cooperate fully with any inquiry . " @entity47 's brother @entity99 plays for third division side @entity100 , and his club said it was " aware " of the allegations that the 33 - year - old and another of his teammates , former @entity106 international @entity105 , are also being investigated by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) . @entity0 has been unable to reach either of the @entity100 players for comment . @entity59 confirmed it is cooperating with the authorities over allegations involving its player @entity112 but -- like @entity100 -- declined to comment further due to the ongoing investigation . @entity115 said it has suspended @entity112 without pay until the investigation is concluded . @entity0 has reached out to @entity112 for comment , but has n't yet connected with him . none of the six players have been charged . five were released on bail until april 2014 , the @entity107 said monday , and the other is still being questioned . it said the @entity42 on sunday had passed on material from its own investigation . @entity20 's @entity127 said the allegations , if proven , " unfortunately demonstrate the real issue football faces in terms of corruption . " " it highlights the necessity of the work carried out by the @entity127 and other stakeholders in the game in educating players of these risks , " the @entity127 said in a statement monday . " we take the issue of integrity very seriously and will continue in our efforts to eradicate this evil from our game . " football authorities have been trying to clamp down on match - fixing and illegal gambling , much of which is driven by @entity150 betting syndicates . in february , @entity152 crime agency @entity151 announced it had probed 680 suspicious matches across the globe including two @entity156 matches and in september authorities in @entity158 made 14 arrests in an attempt to crackdown on football match fixing . there have been arrests after investigations into competitions across @entity152 , in @entity167 and @entity168 , with most involving lower - level teams . there were seven arrests in @entity43 last month as part of the @entity107 probe into a " suspected international illegal betting syndicate " which is targeting lower league matches . this came after four @entity43 players were arrested and charged for alleged match - fixing in @entity168 's @entity179 this year . the quartet , who spent part of last season with clubs in @entity20 's non-league @entity185 -- effectively the country 's sixth division -- have been suspended by football 's world governing body @entity190 . two pleaded guilty and were fined last week , while the other two will return to court on december 20 . the @entity107 confirmed it is working with the @entity193 and the @entity194 as it continues its investigations .
