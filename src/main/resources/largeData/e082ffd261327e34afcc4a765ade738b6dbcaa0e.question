@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- an air of inevitability exists around @entity4 for 2016 . of course she has n't said she will run -- that 's a decision she said she 'll make this year -- but she must feel pretty good about the tea leaves . a new @entity1 / @entity8 poll out this week found that 70 % of @entity9 said they are likely to support her if she launches a presidential bid . additionally , she is beating top - tier @entity14 contenders , including @entity16 gov. @entity15 and former @entity18 gov. @entity17 , in hypothetical matchups . @entity9 strategist @entity20 predicted , with the caveat that a lot can happen between now and then , that if she runs , " i do n't think she 'll have anyone running against her . " that 's because she is in such a strong position with her name recognition and her vast network of supporters , donors and campaign infrastructure ready to go . @entity33 political science professor @entity32 said the chances of @entity35 being upset , like what happened in the 2008 primaries , are slim . " i do n't see who 's going to be the @entity39 of 2016 , " he said . would she say no ? but plenty of reasons exist for her to simply say no. presidential campaigns are unbelievable grinds and they can exact a substantial personal toll . they 're full of endless days , personal attacks , and heart - clogging food . there are infinite details to master , personalities to manage , debates , and then throw in the unknowns . she will be 69 on @entity56 2016 and would have been in the political spotlight for a quarter century by then . she would have run once as the favorite for her party 's nomination and lost . many people might reflect on a similar public service career and conclude there 's nothing left to prove , or that it 's time for others to get in the game even if becoming the first woman president was the prize . but what if @entity35 does n't run ? multiple people associated with the @entity9 say there is a host of promising potential contenders . but one strategist , a veteran of several @entity9 presidential campaigns who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely , said , " people saw governor @entity35 and senator @entity39 as superstars . " as for the potential 2016 crop : " no one talks about the rest of the field that way . " except for @entity85 . " the truth is that , if @entity4 does n't run @entity85 becomes the class of the field by far , " the veteran @entity9 strategist told @entity1 . " it 's got ta be @entity4 or @entity85 or we 're in trouble . " @entity85 has been cagey with his intentions , dropping humorous references but refusing to commit . but his name recognition as vice president and as a veteran of the presidential campaign trail , some in the party think @entity85 is in a good position . though , he would be 73 on @entity56 2016 and 74 on @entity101 . that 's " middle age " for a @entity110 senator , but no one has ever walked into the @entity104 on their first day of work at that age . @entity111 , a former top @entity112 aide , thinks @entity85 " deserves a shot " because he 's been " outstanding " as vice president . but @entity85 is @entity85 . people either love him , hate him or forget about him . for some @entity9 operatives , @entity85 is almost an afterthought . people spouted off numerous potential @entity9 candidates and @entity85 's name would come up , eventually . " oh yes , @entity85 , " said one strategist after gently jogging his memory . the progressive wing of the party is not impressed . @entity125 , co-director of the @entity126 , left it at this : " @entity85 has had a great career in public service . " after the interview concluded , @entity125 e-mailed to say that his co-director , @entity131 , has this to say about a @entity85 run : " that would be funny , " @entity131 said . @entity137 @entity9 pollster @entity138 said @entity9 @entity85 and @entity35 are n't the only two who can appeal to @entity9 voters . the party has " a really strong bench of candidates that people are excited about that have progressive appeal . " she included @entity149 gov. @entity137 , saying he has " quietly and consistently " built a strong record of good schools and good economy in @entity149 . interestingly , in this informal survey of half a dozen @entity9 operatives and one political science professor , people mentioned @entity137 most often than any other possible contender , including @entity85 , but their reaction was far more muted . @entity111 said the " jury is out " and @entity32 mused , " i just do n't know what kind of candidate he 'd be . " @entity125 called @entity137 " a blank slate . " @entity137 is laying the groundwork for a run in the event @entity35 does n't , a source close to the governor told @entity1 . @entity137 amplified 2016 speculation when he told the @entity170 last week that he ca n't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision . @entity174 the first - term @entity176 senator would have even less experience in public office than @entity39 when he ran in 2008 . but @entity9 have a high opinion of the former @entity181 professor whose advocacy paved the way for the @entity184 . former @entity39 aide @entity185 said @entity186 was one of a handful of " impressive " democrats who could fill the bill should @entity35 stay out . @entity20 said @entity186 has to be " put on any list . " the progressives love her for her populist agenda . @entity125 said @entity186 is " the north star " of the @entity9 . @entity195 @entity197 sen. @entity195 's name also came up as a potential contender . but @entity20 said she would have to get over her lack of name recognition , which she said is relatively easy to do . @entity111 , however , said it 's " too soon " for @entity197 sen. @entity195 . she should show her campaigning and fundraising capabilities as head of the @entity206 's @entity112 campaign arm . @entity207 the @entity197 governor received the most negative response from respondents , if he was mentioned at all . @entity111 said @entity207 should " stick to being the governor of @entity197 . " @entity125 said he represents the @entity9 from the 90s and would not fit in well with today 's voters , adding that he " pays lip service " to progressives . more on the bench ? there are other possibilities , including : @entity220 gov. @entity219 , @entity222 gov. @entity221 and @entity176 gov. @entity223 . but even though lifelong people had little to say as they are so unknown on a national scale . " i 'm not sure what i can say , " @entity111 said . " untested " is how @entity33 professor @entity32 described the field outside of @entity85 and @entity35 . " all these other candidates have never run for national office so we do n't know how they 'd do . "
