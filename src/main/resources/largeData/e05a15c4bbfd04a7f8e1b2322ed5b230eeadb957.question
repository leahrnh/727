( @entity1 ) -- " i want to be frozen on the hope that they 'll find whatever i died of and bring me back , " @entity0 told a shocked group of dinner guests gathered at his @entity8 home for a party hosted by him and his wife , @entity13 . " @entity14 : a @entity15 : dinner with the @entity17 " airs at 8 p.m. et sunday . no topic was off - limits when @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 discussed friendship , insecurities , success , worries , life , death and nearly everything in between . @entity34 asked the @entity1 host whether he was " maybe a little obsessed with your own mortality , like i am ? " " oh , i fear death , " @entity0 told the " @entity39 " creator . " my biggest fear is death , because i do n't think i 'm going anywhere . and since i do n't think that , and i do n't have a belief ... i 'm married to someone who has the belief , so she knows she 's going somewhere . " although mortality was a topic of discussion , the dinner party was far from macabre . not only did @entity54 funnyman brand rummage through @entity13 's underwear drawer ( on camera , no less ) , the multicourse meal was prepared by @entity57 . " this is big news , " @entity20 said . " you would like to be frozen ? this is news to me . " " it 's the only hedging of a bet , " answered @entity0 . the comedian and host of @entity66 's ( sister station to @entity1 ) " @entity67 , " still in shock , told the group , " i just want to make sure that we stick with the headline here , which is that you wish to be frozen . " @entity34 wondered aloud whether @entity0 wished to live forever . " yeah , you bet your ass , " @entity0 said . " here 's the thing , " @entity20 continued . . " you just revealed that you want to be frozen ... " " why you hung on that ? " asked @entity0 . " listen , two things just happened , " @entity20 joked . " you revealed you want your head chopped off and frozen , and @entity26 went into your wife 's room and stole your underwear . and now you 're moving on with your prepared questions . " when the subject turned to friendship , @entity0 told the group that he had an " unusual situation " because he remains friends with three individuals he 's known since the age of 10 . " well , these are people you fought in the @entity92 with , @entity0 , " joked @entity20 . " that 's a bond . when you 're fighting the @entity95 , that 's an incredible bond , @entity0 . " @entity22 told party guests that his mother is his best friend . " we started out together in @entity100 , @entity101 , " explained the basketball great . " and throughout all the tough times , she was there . she was really my real role model . my mother 's always been there for me . she 's my best friend . before i do something or say something crazy , i always think about how it could affect her . " @entity34 had similar sentiments . " both my parents were unbelievably supportive , " he said . " they were ex-hippies and so , thank @entity115 , never wanted me to become a lawyer or anything like that . my mom used to call every monday morning after ' @entity39 ' would air , and either rave about the show or say , ' eh , i did n't think this was as funny as some of the other ones . ' and i would always look forward to that call . " @entity34 lost his mother last year after a battle with cancer . @entity20 opened up about the insecurities within him that plague him to this day . he talked about a group of inner - city kids who came to visit the " @entity67 " set . " one of the girls -- she must have been 16 , 17 years old -- said to me , ' how do you get over your insecurity ? when does that go away ? ' and i said , ' you never get over it . ' and she was shocked . " @entity25 also chimed in on insecurities and success . " the prime rule back in the ' 40s was , you have to be humble with your creativity and gracious with your success . we did n't think about money or fame ever . " @entity0 asked @entity150 inventor @entity24 what makes him angry . " inaction , " answered @entity24 . " people seeing something just inhumane going wrong and just not doing anything about it . " @entity0 asked banks what people 's biggest misunderstanding is about her . " when i created my show , " said the fashion and beauty guru , " i also created a persona on ' @entity164 , ' and it 's a character . ... that is a character . i do n't do that . " @entity34 told the group , " i think people , because of ' @entity39 ' , think that i 'm a heartless frat guy , playboy type . could not be further from the truth , i 'm actually very shy . i fall asleep each night with a book in my hands . my favorite movie is ' @entity176 . ' " as dinner wrapped up , @entity0 asked his guests what they were most grateful for . he turned to @entity24 first , and @entity26 reminded him to do so " in 140 characters or less . " @entity24 said he is most grateful for " being able to wake up every day and do what i love . " @entity0 spoke to @entity1 about " dinner with the @entity17 . " " the problem was editing it , " he said . " we did about two hours , but had to edit it down to a one - hour show . " @entity0 said that he would love to do a few dinner party specials a year . " i hope people enjoy it , " @entity0 said . " i hope that enough people like it that we do it on a regular basis . i 've done a lot of things in my life and this was one of the big kicks . i think it 's a great idea and i think that it works . " @entity0 also opened up about some misconceptions about himself . " people sometimes think i 'm sort of all - knowing , " he explained . " when you reach a certain age and people see you on television , they look at you and think , ' wow ! everything must be great ! ' well , everything is n't always great . you can be hailed on the streetcorner , but you still have to go home and take out the garbage . you have one kid who does n't want to go to school , another has an earache . ... " here 's an example : my wife is late getting somewhere . one kid is yelling , another kid is out on his bike , and he has n't come home , and i 'm out in front of the house looking for him , and a tour bus goes by . so i got ta stop and smile and wave at a tour bus . it 's like leading two lives , and it 's crazy . "

@entity23 : he 's not " heartless frat guy , " and his favorite film is " @placeholder "
