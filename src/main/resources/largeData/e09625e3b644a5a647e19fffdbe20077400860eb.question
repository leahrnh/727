( @entity0 ) -- should men be routinely screened for prostate cancer ? this question has been asked ever since the prostate specific antigen test , or @entity5 , became widely available more than two decades ago . @entity6 to this question is another question : does prostate cancer screening save lives ? both questions are hard to answer . screening clearly helps find cancer . but many of the cancers that are diagnosed and treated do not need to be . left alone , they will not harm the patient . and some cancers go on to cause death despite treatment . the right question really is : does screening find some cancers that need to be cured and can be cured ? after an exhaustive process , the @entity21 has announced its final recommendation on @entity5 - based prostate cancer screening . it finds that the known harms of screening outweigh the potential benefits for men who have no cancer symptoms . it notes that all screening studies have demonstrated considerable harms associated with screening , but only one major study found evidence that screening saves lives -- and that study has some internal inconsistencies . it showed screening saves lives in the @entity40 and @entity41 , but not in five other @entity43 countries . even the positive parts of that study did not show a considerable increase in lives saved . the task force 's methods are notable for their scientific rigor . a group of experts in prostate cancer and in evidence appraisal systematically reviewed and reported on all the scientific evidence to date on prostate - cancer screening and treatment . the task force , a second group with expertise in preventive medicine and screening , then considered the review and made a preliminary recommendation . that recommendation was made available for public comment last fall . those comments were then considered before a final recommendation was made . although the task force recommends against routine screening , it does recognize that some men will still want to be screened because of family history or other concerns . the task force vehemently stresses the necessity of informed consent in such cases : men must be told of the known harms of screening . hopefully its strong statement will cause physicians and screening advocates to be more cautious about encouraging screening . for years , professional organizations , including the @entity85 , the @entity86 , the @entity87 and even the @entity88 , have urged caution and informed decision - making regarding screening . these recommendations have largely been ignored . over the past 20 years , many well - meaning people have supported mass screening . celebrities , athletes , politicians and cancer survivors have endorsed screening . mass screening is commonly conducted in shopping malls , churches and community centers , at conventions and state fairs and in vans parked in supermarket parking lots . news : task force says @entity5 tests do more harm than good hospitals , medical practices , fraternities , politicians , radio and tv stations and even an adult diaper manufacturer have sponsored mass screenings . men who attend them are rarely informed of the risks of screening and are often promised unproven benefits . these two decades of mass screening are estimated to have caused more than 1 million @entity127 men to receive unnecessary treatment causing numerous common side effects , including radiation - induced bowel injury , urinary incontinence and impotence , and a significant proportion have serious , life - threatening complications . @entity136 screening is a lucrative business . i am haunted by a conversation i had in the late 1990s with a marketing executive at a major @entity127 hospital who bragged about his " prostate cancer business plan . " his hospital conducted free screening at a local mall every september for @entity148 . he explained that this was not just cheap and effective advertising for his hospital system . it was also a moneymaker . as he explained it , for every 1,000 men over age 50 who were screened at the mall , 145 would have an abnormal screen , and 135 would go to his hospital for evaluation . fees collected from them would easily cover the cost of the free screening event . about 45 in that group would have cancer ; the rest would be false positives . the marketer had figured out how many men would be treated with surgery , radiation , and hormones . he had estimates of all the money the center would make from treating all 45 cancer cases . he knew how many men would be treated for urinary incontinence , and what his net profit for treating that would be . amazingly , he even knew how many of the men would want penile prostheses surgically implanted to treat their impotence . i asked him one question : " how many lives will you save if you screen a thousand men ? " he looked at me as if i were a fool , and said , " do n't you know ? no one knows if this stuff saves lives . i ca n't give you a number on that . " he was right . it would not be until 13 years later , in 2010 , that a clinical trial would finally be published suggesting that screening saves lives -- and that trial has internal inconsistencies making that suggestion suspect . indeed , for two decades , mass @entity5 - based prostate cancer screening was done in this country without direct clinical evidence showing that it was beneficial to patients . it was , of course , very beneficial to those who offered it . while i hope that this new recommendation will put an end to mass screening , i am not optimistic . as @entity221 once said , " it is difficult to get a man to understand something , when his salary depends on his not understanding it . " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .

@placeholder : report should end mass screenings , but it will be tough to slow industry
