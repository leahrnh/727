@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- wednesday is @entity2 , a day for all @entity3 to celebrate the @entity3 . yes , dignitaries gathered and ceremonies took place to mark the holiday in @entity0 . but the national pride mixed with profound dissent as pro-democracy protesters occupied parts of the @entity13 business hub -- not to celebrate the central government in @entity15 , but to denounce and challenge it . live blog : follow @entity1 's coverage of the protests there was a sense , entering wednesday , that the protest ranks could swell with more people off work for the holiday . the movement has seemingly grown regardless , unaffected by clashes with police , thunderstorms and repeated admonitions by authorities who have refused to budge . so there they were , wednesday morning , waking up to chants over loudspeakers calling for the local chief executive 's resignation , for police not to use violence against them and for everyone to " protect @entity0 . " flag - raising protest student pro-democracy leader @entity42 , who was arrested during protests friday and released sunday , led a group of students in a silent protest at the official @entity2 flag - raising ceremony in @entity48 . the group silently turned their backs to the flag and raised their arms in crosses as the @entity3 flag and the flag of @entity0 were raised . " we crossed our arms because we want to express our dissatisfaction toward the government , to reflect our mistrust towards the central @entity3 government , and to object to the @entity64 decision on august 31 , " he said , referring to @entity15 's controversial ruling to allow only candidates approved by a nominating committee to run for office as @entity0 's chief executive . in the build - up to the flag - raising , a statement from @entity42 's @entity49 calling for calm and restraint during the ceremony was widely circulated among protesters on social media networks . " just wear black , stay quiet with your chin down or carry an umbrella , " read a message . " no matter how much you dislike a country , disturbing its flag - raising ceremony will only be disrespectful . " as @entity1 's @entity84 noted from downtown @entity0 , little seemed to have damped demonstrators ' fervor . then again , there was also no sign that authorities are ready to give in . " both sides appear to be digging in their heels , " @entity84 said . when it was transferred from @entity92 to @entity3 control in 1997 , @entity0 was supposed to be the centerpiece of @entity15 's one nation , two systems approach . but protesters fear that independence is slipping away . they decry a recent decision allowing national government leaders to vet -- in other words , decide who is in and who is out -- any candidates up for a vote to lead @entity0 's government . changing that policy is demand no. 1 for the protesters , who say that having every citizen get a vote in an election is moot if the options are decided in @entity15 . a growing number have also blasted @entity0 's current leader for putting the central government ahead of his own citizens and demanded he step down . one demonstrator , @entity118 , explained to @entity1 's @entity84 : " ( we want the government ) just to respect the democracy that @entity0 deserves and really uphold the principle of one country , two systems . " the powers - that - be do n't appear to be in much of a talking mood . they have refused to budge while condemning the protests , which they say are against the law and are undermining @entity0 's economic and security . @entity0 chief executive @entity132 , a day after saying " this illegal protest will not force the central government to go back on its decision august 31 , " said wednesday that people should accept a deal as is . speaking at a @entity2 reception , @entity132 said , " it is understandable that different people may have different ideas about a desirable reform package . but it is definitely better to have universal suffrage than not . " it is definitely better to have the ( chief executive ) elected by five million eligible voters than by 1,200 people . and it is definitely better to cast your vote at the polling station than to stay home and watch on television the 1,200 members of the @entity156 cast their votes . " @entity0 leader : ' this is based on the basic law ' like other chief executives , @entity132 was n't elected by a popular vote but rather by a 1,200 - strong committee stacked with @entity15 loyalists . that was set to change in 2017 . in a way , it will . @entity132 points out that " we will be able to have one - person , one - vote " -- meaning citizens , not just committee members , can cast ballots . but as to which candidates they can choose from , the chief executive said that much has been settled and it wo n't change . " i understand this universal suffrage is somewhat different to what the public thinks it would be , " he said . " but this is based on the basic law . we still want to remain peaceful , calm and think what the best is for @entity0 . " @entity132 has backing from @entity186 groups like @entity187 for @entity0 , who have had their own rallies and run advertising campaigns to preach their message that pro-democracy activists will " endanger @entity0 " and create chaos . while the city of 7 million people is still bustling in some ways , the unrest already has had an impact on one of @entity13 's biggest financial centers . atm services were disrupted and 37 bank branches closed tuesday , according to the @entity203 . @entity132 said ambulances and fire trucks had to be rerouted to get around the crowds . some 157 schools closed tuesday . the @entity0 government canceled the city 's annual @entity2 fireworks display because of the protests . officials in the city have spoken out against the protest and -- at least on sunday -- acted out . that 's when police hurled 87 tear gas canisters into the crowd after they refused to heed calls to disperse , spurring protests . " we gave them enough of a chance to leave , and this included warnings , " assistant police commissioner @entity221 said monday , explaining the police decision . " but when they failed , we had to use force . " such forceful sentiment are n't being heard everywhere , however . leaders in @entity15 have been largely silent about what 's happening in @entity0 . at the @entity235 building in @entity236 on tuesday , @entity1 's @entity233 asked @entity3 's deputy @entity235 ambassador what he thought of the protests . @entity241 replied , " what , where ? @entity0 is part of @entity3 , " and then walked away . activist : ' it 's more or less like @entity246 ' contrast this silence to what 's happening in @entity0 . even as censors blocked access to @entity253 after images of protests flooded the photo - sharing app and @entity3 blocked out reporting on @entity0 in mainland @entity3 , those on the streets managed to make their voices heard in other ways . some took to @entity261 , and a few turned to @entity263 -- including one capturing a collective of umbrellas which , besides shielding at times torrential rain , have become symbols of the protests they are relaying the sentiments of the tens of thousands who have hit the streets . many of them are students like lead organizer @entity274 , who described " the current situation ( as ) totally out of @entity132 's control . " " actually , the government is under great pressure , " he continued , " and we will demand and call for more people " to protest in the coming days . even if more people come out , some say it 's not a fair fight -- not with police fully equipped and demonstrators armed with little more than their umbrellas . @entity287 , a 21 - year - old recent college graduate , is worried authorities will come at them even harder next time . " we ca n't really stop them , " she said . such fears notwithstanding , the activists were n't backing down . if anything , their demands -- including for @entity132 's resignation -- appear to have grown louder . " all the candidates will be pre-selected by @entity15 ... it 's more or less like @entity246 , " protest organizer @entity298 - man said . " but we are an international city . we have a younger generation who have been taught about civil rights , political rights . and we want our words to be heard . " some analysts say they see little hope of compromise between the committed protesters and the @entity311 , which remains notorious for its ruthless suppression of pro-democracy protests in @entity15 's @entity315 in 1989 . " i see no way the @entity3 government can tolerate what is happening in @entity0 . greatly fear this will end badly , " tweeted @entity320 , a senior fellow at the @entity322 - @entity321 at the @entity323 , who covered the @entity315 crackdown for @entity1 . @entity3 authorities apparently tried to restrict the flow of information into the mainland about what was happening in @entity0 . on tuesday , @entity3 blocked out reporting on @entity0 in mainland @entity3 , @entity1 @entity15 correspondent @entity332 said . earlier , censors had blocked access to @entity253 after images of the protests flooded the photo - sharing app. " everybody is in completely unknown territory , " said @entity339 , an associate fellow at @entity341 - based @entity340 . " how these things end , we just do n't know . " @entity1 's @entity346 reported from @entity0 . @entity1 's @entity347 and @entity348 reported and wrote from @entity349 . @entity1 's @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity233 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 contributed to this report .
