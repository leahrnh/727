( @entity0 ) -- his wounds as an @entity3 in @entity4 in 2009 left him in the fight of his life -- a fight for his life , for sheer survival . and when his story was told by the @entity11 , that story brought a packed house in the @entity14 @entity13 to its feet for a standing ovation . " @entity20 never gives up , and he does not quit , " president @entity17 declared to the nation in his @entity19 in january . being singled out for presidential recognition made @entity22 overnight the most recognizable veteran in the country , a position he 's not entirely comfortable with . but he says he 's ok with the attention as long as it brings attention to all wounded veterans . " there are other people who would have quit a long time ago and would have been happy in their wheelchair . me ? oh , no , " he said in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity34 " that aired thursday . it 's incredibly poignant when he makes such statements . his speech is labored and a little slurred . every word and movement clearly takes great effort . but it is effort he makes without complaint , without flinching . before the accident @entity22 joined the @entity45 when he was 18 years old . he wanted to join sooner , but his father , @entity47 , would not let him . he went through the rigorous , specialized training to become an elite @entity3 , deploying to @entity49 and @entity4 10 times . he spent a total of 39 months in combat , and was eventually made leader of his company 's heavy weapons squad . in june 2009 , he participated in ceremony for the 65th anniversary of d - day , parachuting in on the shores of @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , as part of a ceremony president @entity17 attended . afterward , the two met briefly . what @entity22 did n't know then was that he would meet the president again just a year later , under very different circumstances . on october 1 , 2009 , @entity22 and his platoon hit a roadside bomb in @entity72 , @entity4 , and the immediate explosion nearly killed him . he was found face down in a pool of water , shrapnel lodged in his brain . his father still remembers the phone call . " i immediately went into the mode of saying , ' hey @entity20 , how are you doing ? ' " he said . " and there was silence . and that 's when the officer identified himself as @entity20 's company commander and said @entity20 's been injured . " @entity22 was in a coma for more than three months . he 's undergone dozens of surgeries , is still blind in his right eye and is partially paralyzed on his left side . but he 's come a long way from those first few months . an unseen , personal battle at the @entity19 recovery after years of rehabilitation centers and hospitals , @entity22 now lives at home with a full - time caregiver in @entity100 , @entity101 . this week , @entity22 returned to @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 , where he lived for 16 months going through intensive daily therapy to regain his ability to walk and talk . this was his first time back since leaving 10 months ago . everyone there -- doctors , nurses and patients -- all came up to say hi , give him a hug and ask how he 's doing . meeting an @entity14 hero @entity22 acknowledges that his recovery would not have been possible without the support of his family . his stepmother , @entity121 , left her job for more than a year and a half to stay with him full - time at a hospital in @entity125 . and his father 's employer has allowed him the flexibility to be at his son 's side whenever necessary . his parents are also grateful to all the charities that have supported their son 's recovery over the past five years . @entity22 clearly has been through a lot , but one thing he has not lost is his sense of humor . during a speech therapy session that tested articulation and memory , he had to name something from a category -- his favorite baseball team , a color , a state , a street name -- followed by a card number from a deck . when asked to name a news website , he said , " @entity156 , " but then remembered who was in the room with him , and quickly corrected himself by saying , " or , @entity0 . oops . " meetings with the president @entity20 met president @entity17 for the second time in 2010 , shortly after coming out of his coma . the president happened to be visiting @entity162 outside @entity163 , and realized he knew the young man once he saw the photo of their first meeting hanging on the wall near his bed . @entity22 is the only known wounded veteran to have met the president both before and after his injury . their third meeting was about a year ago , when president @entity17 made a stop in @entity100 and requested to see how @entity22 was doing . when @entity17 arrived , @entity22 did something that shocked even his father . " @entity20 got up , saluted him , then got up with a walker and walked across the floor , " @entity47 said . for @entity20 , the gesture was to prove a point : " to show the president that this is what happens when you do n't quit . " @entity188 outpouring for wounded war hero at @entity19 what 's next on wednesday , @entity22 turned 31 . to celebrate his birthday , he took a tandem skydiving jump ; his first since his injury . he 's also working with a therapy dog that will help him do some of the things he can no longer do for himself . he says his heroes are his @entity198 buddies who gave their lives serving their country . he wears a bracelet engraved with their names as a reminder of their ultimate sacrifice . his long - term goals are to go to college , get married and have children , to live a full life , just like anyone else . opinion : veterans should n't politicize the honoring of a fellow vet watch @entity34 weekdays at 6am - 9am et. for the latest on @entity34 click here
