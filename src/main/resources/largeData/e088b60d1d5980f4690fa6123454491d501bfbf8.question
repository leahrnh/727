@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 and dr. @entity3 tried to recruit an anesthesiologist to join them on his comeback tour , according to testimony in the @entity9 wrongful death trial . @entity3 arranged the meeting in march 2009 in which @entity2 asked dr. @entity10 to travel with him to @entity12 , @entity10 testified . @entity10 said that after he offered to take the job for $ 100,000 a month guaranteed for three years , @entity3 stopped communicating with him . " i texted basically , you know , ' what 's going on , i 'm on board , " @entity10 said . " and no response . " just weeks later @entity3 accepted an offer from an @entity9 executive to be @entity2 's personal physician on his " @entity22 " tour for $ 150,000 a month . @entity3 told investigators he began infusing @entity2 with the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia in april , a treatment that eventually killed the pop icon . @entity28 : @entity29 ' has no life ' since father 's death jurors in the trial of @entity2 's last concert promoter viewed the video depositions of @entity10 and two other witnesses wednesday ahead of a six - day break in testimony . @entity2 's mother and children are suing @entity9 , contending the company 's executives negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity3 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity2 's propofol overdose death . @entity9 's lawyers argue it was @entity2 -- not its executives -- who chose and controlled @entity3 and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the singer in the privacy of his bedroom . @entity2 : ' help me get my rest ' @entity10 , who administered propofol to @entity2 during cosmetic dental procedures in @entity57 four times in 2008 , said @entity2 and @entity3 never told him what his duties would be if he took a job with the tour . " i said ' i do n't sing and i really ca n't dance , so to do what ? " @entity10 testified . " he says ' well , you know , i 'm entertaining , i 'm jumping around , i 'm doing this . every once in a while i need an iv , " @entity10 testified . " and he says ' i just need you to help me get my rest . ' they were pretty vague , but on hindsight i know what they were talking about . " @entity2 and @entity3 , however , never mentioned that administering propofol or treating his insomnia would be one of his responsibilities on tour , the anesthesiologist testified . @entity2 never asked him to do anything medically inappropriate , @entity10 said . @entity10 hinted that there was jealously on @entity3 's part when @entity2 courted him for a tour job . " @entity3 really looked like he had just lost his best friend " when @entity2 was discussing it , @entity10 said . " oh , he was truly upset . " defense expert : promoter did n't pressure @entity2 's doctor @entity3 told @entity1 's @entity89 in april that @entity2 had " his own stash " of propofol in his home before he began treating him with it . " i did not agree with @entity2 , but @entity2 felt that it was not an issue because he had been exposed to it for years and he knew exactly how things worked , " @entity3 said . " and given the situation at the time , it was my approach to try to get him off of it , but @entity2 was not the kind of person you can just say ' put it down ' and he 's going to do that . " @entity2 lawyers argue that @entity9 was negligent for not checking out @entity3 's distressed financial situation before agreeing to pay him $ 150,000 a month . it created a conflict of interest that led @entity3 to ignore safe practices and his responsibility to @entity2 's health , they contend . @entity9 executives also ignored a series of red flags that should have warned them that @entity2 's health was deteriorating under @entity3 's care and another doctor should have been called in , they argue . @entity10 was in a @entity57 operating room on june 25 , 2009 , when he learned @entity2 had died . " i texted @entity3 ' i 'm sorry to hear what happened . take care , ' " he said . @entity3 never responded , he said . dr. @entity3 's connection to @entity2 @entity3 did respond that night to a phone call from another @entity10 . @entity128 is the person who initially introduced him to @entity2 in february 2007 when the singer needed a doctor to treat one of his children in @entity57 . @entity128 -- no relation to dr. @entity10 -- had known @entity3 for years and the cardiologist had treated his father 's heart ailment in 2007 . his video deposition was shown to jurors wednesday morning . he testified that he called dr. @entity139 to offer his help after he saw on television that @entity2 had died . " i told him he had taken care of my father for me and i would be at his side until this situation was complete , " @entity10 testified . @entity3 told him that night " he was going to need a lawyer , " he said . he and @entity139 " did everything together " from june 26 , 2009 -- a day after @entity2 's death -- until november 7 , 2011 -- the day @entity3 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter , he said . @entity128 said he served as @entity3 's bodyguard for more than two years without pay . despite his close relationship to @entity3 , @entity10 said he has not spoken to the doctor since he was put in handcuffs in the courtroom and taken to jail . @entity3 is expected to be released from jail on october 28 , 2013 -- after serving two years of a four - year prison sentence , according to his lawyer . doctor 's competed to give @entity2 painkillers , ex-wife says @entity3 and @entity2 : " seemed very odd " @entity3 's relationship with @entity2 " seemed very odd , " according to @entity57 plastic surgeon dr. @entity164 . jurors also watched his video deposition wednesday . " he presented himself as being mr. @entity2 's personal physician and spokesperson to some extent " when @entity3 accompanied @entity2 on an appointment to have cosmetic filler put in his face on may 14 , 2007 , @entity164 said . @entity164 had treated @entity2 several times four years earlier , but not when @entity3 was with him -- and he even wrote a $ 1,300 check to pay for the procedure , he said . " the whole situation seemed very odd and it did n't add up and that caused me not to fully trust the person , " @entity164 testified . " i felt like a successful cardiologist does n't go around being somebody 's private physician and speaking for them , in my experience . " @entity2 , however , appeared to be capable of dealing with doctors on his own , @entity164 said . " he gave me the impression that he was used to telling doctors what he wanted them to do . " @entity2 personally called him in 2002 when he was looking for a doctor in @entity57 to give him collagen and @entity191 treatments , he said . " at first i thought it was somebody playing a prank , one of my friends fooling around , " @entity164 said . he realized it really was the pop star when he called him back at his hotel -- asking for him under his alias " @entity200 , " he said . wednesday was the 74th day of testimony on the trial , which the judge predicted would last another month .
