( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 : as i headed down the mountainside after the @entity5 , it became clear : the theme , " @entity7 , " should be attached to the event itself . i have already tweeted my personal conclusion to the forum : a missed opportunity to start a dialogue on real change . it had an overloaded agenda and too many corporate executives with no idea what they were supposed to be doing besides seeing clients and drumming up business . i do n't mean there should be fewer participants . @entity5 constantly reminds me the number is steady , at around 2,500 . but there are now so many advisers , spokesmen and assistants who attend , that 2,500 is multiplied many times . access is more difficult , honesty becomes harder . to quote the musical @entity34 , it 's " a ghastly mess . " it 'll always need the @entity36 . this year 's was @entity38 president @entity37 who said nothing new , but in a very engaging way . there is nothing wrong with a @entity45 - style headliner to draw ' em in . it 's the other " stuff " that gets in the way . keep it simple . the symptoms are everywhere . walking along the @entity52 , i was horrified with the numbers of @entity54 , bmws , and @entity56 causing a massive traffic jam . limos are fine for prime ministers or presidents who need the security , but there 's no need for @entity64 or executive to have one as a status symbol . the @entity5 provides an excellent shuttle service . if @entity69 's president @entity68 and his wife can walk , chatting with all on the way , @entity64 can too . getting away from the corporate bubble and sycophancy is the joy of @entity75 . @entity5 should restrict the number of passes for limos in the parking lots . they need to keep it simple . onto the theme itself . if any @entity85 writers delivered such verbose language i would send back the script . this year 's theme had merit , if anyone could get through work their way through the @entity94 language . keep it simple ! finally , the panels . there are too many and the format is tired . the subjects , like the theme , are often esoteric and obscure . the @entity101 , @entity103 , @entity102 for @entity104 . these may raise interesting points , but they are just a laundry list of jargon . the @entity75 panel is a tired way of engaging in debate . surely it is not beyond the wit of @entity5 to change . oh , and , keep it simple . i realise it is de rigueur to criticize @entity75 . those of us who have attended for years will nostalgically claim " it 's not as good as it used to be . " that 's not what i am saying . the event serves a very real purpose , allowing people to think , discuss , ponder and connect . but only if it strips back the hoopla and hullaballoo and gets back to basics -- reshaping itself to accommodate new ways of doing business , not just exhorting us to do it in the real world . does this mean that my colleague @entity136 won the debate we had over whether @entity75 can help solve inequality ? absolutely not . @entity75 is still exactly the right place to raise such issues ; it 's where the decision makers come to hear the arguments and ponder the possibilities . so , @entity75 , i will be back next year ( if you invite me ) but i suggest before you start urging us to reshape the world you look into your own soul and do a bit of reshaping yourself . @entity150 : in making a big push to talk about inequality , the @entity5 drew cries of derision from those present and absent from the @entity75 meetings this year . " how can a bunch of billionaires truly understand the difference between privilege and poverty ? " asked commentators including myself . besides , does n't discussing the wealth gap among world elites smack of hypocrisy ? and what impetus would they really have to enact change , especially if the status quo should suit them just fine ? yet in tackling the thorny issue -- if arguably years too late -- 2014 's event did a good job of breaking down today 's disparities and examining them from a variety of angles . because we should remember that inequality comes in many guises : from health to access to education , water and food . and then there is there 's the glass ceiling , which reared its ugly head in this year 's @entity5 demographics as it emerged only 15 % of participants were women today versus 17 % in 2011 . @entity193 coo @entity192 bemoaned the persistence of discrimination in the workplace , alongside @entity197 , the first female managing director of the @entity198 . while @entity200 , head of the @entity201 , was keen to remind me it 's not just the number of women in positions of power that count , it 's their ability to have the confidence to speak up that also matters . another prominent female delegate was @entity211 , who moderated a panel on " the @entity213 " and explained how inequality had now broken free of its traditional emerging markets homeland and emerged as a new plague of the developed economies . the good news is that the collective conscience is finally starting to turn . but as usual , when it comes to concrete measures to fight what the @entity5 identifies as one of the world 's biggest risks , the fur - swaddled @entity75 crowd is as flaky as the snow blanketing its plush pistes . @entity230 says : after nearly a quarter century of covering @entity75 , there is a simple formula i use to measure the top story here -- look at the " wow factor " when a leader passes through the main conference center floor . @entity75 2014 belonged to @entity38 president @entity37 . @entity37 marched down the staircase with an entourage of about 30 ministers , diplomats and security personnel . then the " @entity245 " kicked in . chief executives , policy makers and young global leaders stopped their conversations and peered over to the leader clad in his white turban and black cloak . @entity253 overcame the floor as the pack passed by . the @entity38 president spoke before the @entity75 crowd about a new foreign policy of moderation , but there are plenty who harbor reservations about the country 's interim nuclear development agreement that eased sanctions for six months . @entity268 senator @entity267 told me that @entity37 's comments about not giving up a single centrifuge could build momentum for another sanctions bill in @entity274 . " if there are more comments like that and declarations on the part of the @entity38 then i think you will see some impetus behind those sanctions which would override the objections of the president , ( @entity287 ) " he said in our interview . so this @entity75 benefited from being at the start of the six month agreement where policy makers and businessmen could sit face - to - face with the relatively new @entity38 leadership . on the sidelines here , @entity37 reportedly held two separate meetings , one with chief executives of energy companies , the other with a wider array of business leaders from the consumer sector . the @entity38 president already identified seven @entity268 and @entity304 energy companies he would like to invite back . @entity38 is a big energy prize , with 157 billion barrels of proven reserves and the largest single gas field in the world . it 's a market of 76 million consumers , so plenty of opportunity if a final agreement can be reached . skeptics abound and this is the beginning of a long and pot - holed filled diplomatic road which includes the influence @entity38 exercises over @entity320 . but @entity75 2014 will be remembered where the six - month trial period began in earnest . read more : @entity325 's selfie challenge @entity326 on @entity328 's ' heartbreaking ' troubles @entity329 : how your wage compares around the world full coverage of the @entity5
