( @entity0 ) -- the leadership of @entity2 appeared to pass to a third generation of the @entity5 family monday after the weekend death of @entity7 , who ruled the reclusive stalinist state since 1994 . the man known as the " dear leader " died of a heart attack saturday at age 69 , state news outlets announced monday . the ruling @entity14 declared the youngest of his three sons , @entity17 , the " great successor " to his father 's mantle . @entity7 had led @entity2 since his father -- the nation 's founder , @entity20 -- died at age 82 . during his 17 years in power , the country suffered a devastating famine even as it built up its million - strong army , expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world 's eighth declared nuclear power . news of his death spurred @entity35 , which remains technically at war with the @entity2 more than five decades after their 1950 - 53 conflict , to put its military on high alert . but across one of the world 's most heavily fortified borders , @entity35 president @entity40 told his citizens " to go about their lives " in the meantime . " for the sake of the future of the @entity35 , peace and stability on the @entity50 is more important than anything else . it should not be threatened by what has happened , " he said . and @entity56 , the @entity35 consul in @entity57 , told @entity0 's " @entity61 " that @entity59 's top priority is to avoid " anything troublesome . " " i do n't think that @entity2 can afford some provocation at this point , but we must make sure that everything is ok , " he said . @entity2 tested nuclear weapons in 2006 and 2009 . monday , it fired a short - range missile over the @entity68 -- but gen. @entity69 , the chairman of the @entity70 , told @entity0 that @entity72 officials have seen no sign of any movement of @entity76 forces across the @entity77 that separates the @entity2 . @entity76 officers had reported plans for its missile test to the commission that monitors the 1953 armistice , @entity69 said during a trip to @entity85 . he said no heightened alert has been issued for the nearly 30,000 @entity72 troops in @entity35 , which has a mutual - defense pact with the @entity72 . in @entity90 , the @entity89 said it was monitoring developments and hoped to see the @entity97 " take steps to assure the peace and prosperity of its people , " as @entity89 spokesman @entity98 put it . " our focus is on coordinating closely with our allies and partners , " he said . " we have reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to the stability of the @entity50 and the security of our allies , @entity35 and @entity107 . " and after a meeting with @entity107 's foreign minister @entity110 , @entity72 secretary of state @entity108 told reporters that @entity90 has been in " close touch " with the other countries involved in the six - party @entity76 nuclear talks , including @entity116 and @entity117 . " we reiterate our hope for improved relations with the people of @entity2 , and remain deeply concerned about their well being , " she said . a look back at the life of @entity7 @entity98 said president @entity124 was notified of @entity5 's death by his chief of staff about 10:30 p.m. sunday . " i believe it was established in news reports that the @entity76 made that announcement , " @entity98 said . on @entity2 's state television network , a tearful anchor broke the news monday morning . the news was followed by scenes of similarly emotional residents of the capital @entity137 . " my leader , what will we do ? it 's too much ! it 's too much ! " one person sobbed . " leader , please come back . ... you can not leave us . we will always wait for you , leader . " the network said @entity5 died of " overwork " while " dedicating his life to the people . " and the official news agency @entity153 said @entity5 suffered " great mental and physical strain " while on a train . @entity5 enjoyed a cult - like status in the nation , with millions schooled to accept him as a divine and benevolent father figure . @entity162 , one of two @entity72 journalists arrested after entering @entity2 in march 2009 and sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in august 2009 following intervention by former president @entity166 , told @entity0 's " @entity169 " monday that she was allowed to watch television while in custody . nearly every broadcast featured images of @entity5 as an " otherwordly figure , " she said , recalling her guards were " moved to tears watching their ' dear leader , ' and they talked about how much he was doing ( for the people . ) " the guards said @entity5 's health was failing because he worked so hard for @entity76 , she said . her sister , @entity181 , filmed a documentary in @entity2 while posing as part of a medical team that performed eye surgeries . in a clip from the documentary , a young girl 's bandages are removed and she could see for the first time . " it 's all because of the great general , " her jubilant father exclaims . " we must bow to our great general for this . " there was no independent confirmation of the circumstances reported by the government , which routinely touted the military , technological and artistic genius of the " dear leader " -- even claiming he shot 11 holes in one in his first golf outing . but he had appeared frail in his last public appearances , and speculation about his health had persisted for some time . @entity153 acknowledged that @entity5 had been treated for " cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for a long period . " he suffered a heart attack on saturday and could n't be saved despite the use of " every possible first - aid measure , " according to the agency . in @entity90 , the @entity89 said @entity124 spoke with @entity40 on monday morning . the two leaders agreed to stay in " close touch as the situation develops , " it said . several of @entity2 's neighbors , including @entity107 , the @entity220 and leading ally @entity117 , offered condolences to the @entity76 people on @entity5 's death . @entity117 president @entity224 visited the @entity76 embassy in @entity226 tuesday to offer condolences , according to the @entity117 state - run news agency @entity228 . monday night , secretary of state @entity166 issued a statement acknowledging the " period of national mourning " in @entity2 . " we are deeply concerned with the well being of the @entity76 people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times , " the statement said . " it is our hope that the new leadership of the ( @entity76 ) will choose to guide their nation onto the path of peace by honoring @entity2 's commitments , improving relations with its neighbors and respecting the rights of its people , " @entity166 said . " the @entity72 stands ready to help the @entity76 people and urges the new leadership to work with the international community to usher in a new era of peace , prosperity and lasting security on the @entity50 . " earlier , @entity258 , a former @entity72 diplomat who led @entity72 delegation in nuclear talks with @entity2 , said any @entity72 statement would require a certain finesse . " i 'd be very careful about issuing condolences on the death of someone who 's really been part and parcel of one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world , " @entity258 told @entity0 . " on the other hand , i think something can be done that will show some sympathy to the @entity76 . " this just in : up - to - the minute news on the death of @entity7 the deceased leader 's body will remain for a week at the @entity279 in @entity137 , where his father is also interred . memorial services will follow on december 28 and 29 . @entity282 , a former @entity72 ambassador to the @entity283 who has visited @entity2 eight times , said his initial reaction to @entity5 's death was " extreme concern . " he said he is more concerned about stability in the region now than before @entity5 's death . " the peninsula is a tinderbox , " said @entity282 , who has brokered diplomatic deals in the @entity2 . " the issue is , will there be stability in the @entity76 leadership ? will they continue their recent efforts of engaging @entity35 and the @entity72 over food aid , over nuclear talks ? " @entity282 said @entity35 was right to go on alert -- " but i think now 's the time to just lie low , watch things as they develop . " @entity304 : send us your reaction during @entity5 's tenure , the @entity2 was largely closed off to outside influences and fearful of threats from its neighbors . at the same time , it also sought international aid after extensive famines contributed to the deaths of at least 250,000 people , according to the @entity76 government . outside analysts suggested the toll could have been 10 times higher . both @entity2 and @entity35 have shown signs of concession in recent years . but relations between the two rival nations soured yet again when the @entity35 accused the @entity97 of launching an attack on the @entity35 island of @entity325 , killing two @entity35 marines and two civilians . and @entity35 says a @entity76 torpedo attack was to blame for the 2010 sinking of the @entity35 warship @entity331 , which left 46 @entity333 sailors dead . the @entity97 has denied the accusation . now the question is what path his untested son , believed to be either 27 or 28 , will take the country . he was educated in @entity340 as a boy , and named a four - star general in 2010 . " we really do n't know substantively where he stands on anything , " said @entity343 , a senior fellow at the @entity72 - @entity344 . @entity56 said the @entity2 has built up its military and pursued a nuclear bomb " while children are starving . " " this causes a lot of human disasters , " he said . " so what worries me is not this @entity17 's personality , but the priority of the @entity76 leadership . " after the @entity331 incident , then - @entity72 defense secretary @entity359 said he feared the younger @entity5 may have needed to " earn his stripes " with @entity137 's military establishment by launching further provocations . and @entity258 said while the " great successor " is " definitely not ready for prime time , " he is unlikely to take major steps before consolidating his power . " i think we 're kind of shifting , at least for the time being , to a sort of military junta , " he said , adding , " i would expect that they will try to show a maximum of stability as they go through what 's obviously going to be a very difficult and dicey time for them . " @entity0 's @entity40 , @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity382 contributed to this report .
