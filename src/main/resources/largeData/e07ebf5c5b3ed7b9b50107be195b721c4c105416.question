@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- capt. @entity3 was behind the controls of @entity5 as the plane headed to @entity7 when a stewardess delivered a note from a passenger saying the flight was being hijacked . nearly 30 years later , @entity3 still recalls the sense of dread wash over him as he read the hijacker 's demand to be flown to @entity1 . " it 's such a shock that for the first 30 seconds you ca n't remember your name , " @entity3 said . " but then it all falls into place . " @entity3 was an @entity22 veteran who , exactly 15 years to the day of the hijacking , had been shot down in @entity24 . over the plane 's intercom system , @entity3 tried to negotiate with the hijacker , a pistol - wielding man dressed in black , who called himself " lt. spartacus . " the hijacker threatened to take the lives of the 57 passengers and crew aboard the plane if @entity3 did n't fly him to @entity0 . in addition to the small pistol he had smuggled aboard , the hijacker claimed to have a bomb in his suitcase . " he said he had a detonator , " @entity3 remembered , " and that he was prepared to blow up the airplane . " @entity42 : when hijackings were common the airline told @entity3 to comply with the hijacker 's demands . the pilot remembers seeing @entity49 military c - 130s accompany him south and then , as he approached @entity1 air space , turn back . shortly after landing in @entity0 , @entity3 said his plane was surrounded by a bright green swarm of @entity1 soldiers . the @entity1 had plenty of experience with hijacked planes from the @entity49 . after @entity58 took power , the island became the go - to destination for dozens of hijackers -- some were aspiring revolutionaries , others common criminals seeking refuge in a country where the lack of diplomatic relations with the @entity49 meant they were unlikely to be extradited . @entity3 said the @entity1 soldiers removed the passengers and crew , swept the plane for explosives and found nothing . then the soldiers escorted the hijacker off the aircraft . " i only got a glimpse of him , " @entity3 said . " i never understood what he was trying to do . " @entity49 doctors see @entity49 jailed in @entity1 this week , the world is getting another glimpse of the hijacker , a former @entity83 named @entity87 , now 56 , who returned to the @entity49 on wednesday to turn himself into authorities for the 1984 hijacking . @entity92 agents arrested him at @entity93 on charges of air piracy , federal prosecutors said in a statement . he is scheduled to make his first appearance in front of federal magistrate on thursday . if convicted , prosecutors said , he faces a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum term of life behind bars . @entity87 has already served time in @entity1 for his crime . he had hijacked the plane thinking he would be greeted as fellow revolutionary and given military training so he could begin his own uprising in the @entity49 . instead , the @entity1 government tried @entity111 and sentenced him to 15 years in prison . " in a machiavellian sense , the @entity1 changed , " @entity87 said . " they simply changed . they used to do it and now they do n't do it . " instead of becoming the next @entity118 , @entity87 found himself a foreigner who spoke little @entity120 in crowded and often violent prisons . but he refused @entity1 offers to return home . " if you are not able to suffer for the cause you are just a play revolutionary , " he said . @entity1 and @entity49 talk mail cooperation @entity87 served his time and after leaving prison married and had two daughters with a @entity1 woman . although a minor celebrity in his neighborhood of crumbling @entity134 buildings east of @entity0 , @entity87 never fully fit into @entity1 society . he converted to @entity136 and often wears a prayer cap and flowing robes accessorized with a combat vest . the pidgin @entity120 he learned behind bars is combined with the occasional word in @entity143 or @entity144 . @entity87 said he yearns to see family , including two daughters born in @entity1 who now live in the @entity49 . and he said he no longer feels the same zeal he once did for @entity1 's political system . " two generations were forced to sacrifice everything and we ca n't give our children a decent lunch , we ca n't give our old people a decent meal , " he said . " that 's after 50 years of revolution . " homesick @entity49 hijacker offers to return from @entity1 even though he 's a fugitive after being indicted by a @entity49 court for the hijacking in 1985 , @entity87 has been trying to turn himself over to @entity49 authorities for more than a year . federal prosecutors have never explained the year - long delay in bringing him into custody . in a statement wednesday , @entity49 attorney @entity172 " commended the investigative efforts of the @entity92 and the assistance of the @entity167 , @entity168 and the @entity169 in securing @entity87 's return to the @entity49 . " @entity87 said before he could leave @entity1 , @entity49 diplomats had to issue him a single - use passport and an exemption from the no - fly list . there also were to be two @entity49 marshals accompanying him on the flight to @entity7 on wednesday , @entity87 said , in case he has second thoughts . but the one - time hijacker will return to an uncertain future . @entity87 was unable to negotiate a plea deal and , while he hopes any sentence he faces in the @entity49 would be reduced by the time he has served , there are no guarantees . " i did the crime but i did the time , " @entity87 said before his arrest in the @entity49 . " i paid the price for that crime i committed , i am entitled to a second chance . " when he sent his daughters to live in the @entity49 and watched their plane take off , he said he was filled with regret for having hijacked a plane . " i live with the dread of what would have happened if the plane went down , " @entity87 said . " i did n't have that perspective at the time , but i have it now and will have it until the day i die . i would have been responsible for all those people dying . " it 's not clear whether @entity87 will ask for forgiveness from the passengers and crew of @entity205 , many of whom are no longer alive or only dimly recall their brief diversion to @entity1 . now retired after 37 years of flying , @entity3 vividly remembers the ordeal of the hijacking , trying to keep the plane 's passengers calm while complying with @entity87 ' orders . asked whether he would accept an apology from @entity87 , @entity3 said he holds no grudges . " i would consider it , " he said . @entity1 newspaper alleges bribes for @entity49 visas
