@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- after an off - season of big - money transfers and endless speculation in @entity7 the focus finally turns to matters on the pitch . the first round of @entity12 fixtures kick off this weekend and @entity14 details what to expect from the new campaign : so what 's new ? no sooner had @entity18 wrapped up an historic treble than all of the focus shifted to rivals @entity22 following the much - vaunted return of @entity24 as the club 's president . the start of @entity24 's latest spell at the @entity29 has seen a revival of the ' @entity32 ' policy of the early 2000s as the club cherry - picked star players from around @entity35 in a bid to recapture former glories . @entity22 smashed the world transfer record twice in a week as winger @entity39 arrived from @entity40 for $ 130 million hot on the heels of the signing of @entity44 playmaker @entity43 from @entity45 for $ 92m . who do you think will win @entity12 ? sound off below . @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 were also brought to the club as @entity22 splashed out a whopping $ 365m on new players . @entity18 clinched the signing of @entity56 from @entity57 with @entity58 moving in the opposite direction while @entity57 's attacking full - back @entity61 also arrived at the @entity62 . @entity22 's frenzied activity in the transfer market has somewhat overshadowed the appointment of former @entity67 coach @entity66 in place of interim boss @entity69 while @entity70 takes over from the @entity71 at @entity72 . other managerial changes see @entity74 take charge of @entity76 in their debut season in @entity12 while @entity78 has left @entity79 for @entity80 with @entity81 the new man in the hot seat at @entity84 . elsewhere , the start of @entity87 's first season at their new @entity89 stadium has been overshadowed by the shock death of 26 - year - old captain @entity91 who suffered a heart attack after training during preseason . new signings @entity39 and @entity43 will play a key role in @entity22 's quest to win the @entity12 title . key players : it is hard to look beyond the potent attacking threat of @entity39 , @entity43 and @entity48 who are all set to make their @entity12 debuts for @entity22 . but it could well be that @entity49 's decision to return to @entity7 which will prove the most decisive , especially if the midfielder can replicate the kind of form he showed in his final season at @entity111 . @entity56 's move to @entity18 raised a few eyebrows and how @entity114 manages to fuse the enigmatic @entity115 international with the talents of @entity118 , @entity120 et al will be crucial to whether they can match the success of last season . @entity123 found the net 32 times to secure the @entity126 award for the most goals in @entity12 and his partnership with fellow striker @entity129 will provide the backbone of their hopes of improving on last season 's fourth place . will @entity22 's expensive new signings deliver the @entity12 title ? sound off below . elsewhere , @entity136 remains the main man at @entity138 while big things are expected of talented young winger @entity140 at @entity141 after making his debut last term . despite intense speculation @entity138 have kept hold of @entity136 for their final season at the @entity147 . key clubs : @entity22 have spent big to try and close the gap between themselves and defending champions @entity18 and a lot will depend on whether they can turn their potential into effective team performances . the task facing @entity155 will be how to accommodate all of the players in his talent - laden squad , while @entity114 's problem will be how he emulates a superb first season in charge of the @entity18 . despite their financial woes @entity138 have managed to keep hold of prize assets @entity136 and @entity166 . and there will be a heightened level of expectancy among the club 's supporters as the club look to end their 87 - year stay at @entity147 with silverware before moving to a new stadium it also promises to be a fascinating season at @entity67 as they look to life under new coach @entity70 following five seasons under @entity66 . @entity18 coach @entity114 will hope @entity56 settles into life at the @entity62 quickly . expert view : @entity2 's @entity188 - " so @entity22 have splashed the cash , but will the massive $ 365 million investment translate into success on the field ? that is the question football fans are asking themselves leading up to the start of the season . " there is enough talent in @entity22 's squad for the team to aspire to greatness . on paper , they have all the necessary elements to succeed and perhaps emulate @entity18 and their historic treble - winning season . however we all know that football is not played on paper and i personally believe @entity22 have no chance of achieving that . " @entity209 was not built in one day and neither will a treble - winning team . @entity39 and @entity43 will be fantastic this season , i have no doubt of that , while @entity48 and @entity49 have made the side stronger , but @entity22 can only aspire to win one trophy this season . " i think the new coach @entity66 will struggle to find the right balance in the team and therefore the league title will probably escape them . " as far as the @entity222 is concerned , though , i would definitely rank real in the top three sides to lift the trophy . the final will be played at the @entity29 and everyone at the club would love to end a @entity35 drought which started back in 2002 on home turf . " despite all their success last season , defending @entity7 and @entity35 champions @entity18 shook up their squad in the summer . @entity58 , scorer of 38 goals in all competitions last season , left for @entity57 . in exchange for the @entity238 striker , manager @entity114 got @entity56 . " the @entity115 international 's goalscoring record is inferior to @entity58 but he does add a different dimension . for the first time in a long time @entity18 will have a tall striker who can make an impact in the air , as well as create his own chances in the area and bring others into play . " it was a good move for the @entity251 when you consider that @entity58 hardly endeared himself to the team 's dressing room . he was a winner , but he was also a whiner . " there is no question the title will be decided between @entity22 and @entity18 , with my vote going to the defending champions , but we should watch out for @entity264 . " as far as i am concerned , this is one of the most exciting teams in @entity35 football and last season they won five of their last six games . " with @entity129 leading the way , anything is possible and i believe this is will be a big year for ' @entity275 ' who should edge out @entity118 as the one to watch . from what i have seen in preseason , he is going to set the league on fire ! shame their defense is a bit shaky , although they signed @entity7 international @entity285 from @entity286 . " overall i expect @entity18 to take the title -- the backbone of the team remains intact and the chemistry in the team is fantastic . they will have to dig deep to beat @entity22 , but my hunch is that they will be able to do it . at the wrong end of @entity12 , @entity295 , @entity76 and @entity296 will all do well to avoid the drop . "
