@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity3 ' top investigator in @entity4 reacted angrily friday to a report that the former @entity7 employee accused of killing an @entity9 vice presidential guard was hired by another @entity11 contractor weeks later . rep. @entity12 says the @entity13 is covering up " an epidemic of corruption " in @entity9 . the report comes alongside rep. @entity12 's warning of a " confrontation " with secretary of state @entity19 over how much @entity11 should be able to learn about corruption in @entity9 . in a sharply worded letter , @entity12 demanded @entity21 turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor , @entity25 . " serious questions now exist about whether the @entity13 may have withheld from the @entity29 facts about this @entity7 contractor 's shooting of the @entity9 guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the @entity37 , " wrote @entity12 , chairman of the @entity26 . @entity25 is accused of fatally shooting an @entity9 guard and fleeing the scene , according to a @entity4 memo describing the investigation report . he was fined , fired and flown home from @entity9 , and the company later paid $ 20,000 in compensation to the victim 's family . @entity25 returned to the @entity11 within a few days of the incident , his attorney said , but in february he returned to @entity51 working for @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , a company spokesman said . @entity1 reported thursday night that @entity52 said it was unaware of the december incident when it hired @entity25 , because the @entity13 and @entity7 kept the incident quiet and out of @entity25 's personnel records . @entity12 wrote it is " hard to reconcile this development " with previous assertions @entity13 officials have made in recent days . @entity12 earlier accused @entity21 and the @entity13 of a cover - up of what he called " an epidemic of corruption " in @entity9 in general . he branded the @entity13 's anti-corruption efforts " dysfunctional , under - funded and a low priority . " @entity12 further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in @entity9 , especially relating to @entity9 prime minister @entity69 . " corruption is increasing in @entity9 , and the @entity13 ca n't keep us from knowing that -- ca n't censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [ @entity76 , " @entity12 said at the @entity71 hearing . watch @entity12 ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors Â» deputy secretary of state @entity79 repeatedly refused to answer questions from @entity12 about @entity9 corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret . asked if he believes the @entity9 government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption , @entity79 responded , " mr. chairman , questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with @entity9 are best answered in a classified setting . " but he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that @entity69 has taken to improve matters , commending the prime minister for dispatching @entity9 forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market . but @entity12 appeared unmoved . " why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things ? " he asked . " should n't we have the whole picture ? " " i 'd be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting , " @entity79 replied . @entity12 laughed and asked , " an appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing , but for negative things , it must be behind closed doors ? " " as you know , this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security , " @entity79 said . " it goes to the very heart of propaganda , " @entity12 said , putting funding for anti-corruption activities through june 15 , 2006 , at $ 65 million , " or less than 0.003 percent of the total " spent by the @entity123 . the @entity13 said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and @entity9 allies . in a letter to @entity21 last week , @entity12 called the department 's position " ludicrous . " fellow @entity3 rep. @entity134 of @entity135 agreed . " it 's pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [ @entity140 government , " he said . earlier , the former head of the @entity142 , judge @entity143 , told the hearing that @entity69 had protected family members from corruption investigations , citing @entity147 , @entity9 's former transportation minister and the prime minister 's cousin . @entity150 resigned last month and fled @entity9 after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed . he said corruption has affected " virtually every agency and ministry , including some of the most powerful officials in @entity9 . " " corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level , on economic reconstruction , on basic services , amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law , " he told the committee , estimating the total lost to corruption at $ 18 billion . in @entity170 , @entity9 government spokesman @entity169 acknowledged his country is plagued with a " high level " of corruption , but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem . @entity11 comptroller general @entity176 , head of the @entity177 , said there appeared to be no @entity11 plan for countering the corruption . he urged @entity4 to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan " so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts . " @entity12 questioned whether @entity9 's government was " too corrupt to succeed . " if so , he added , " we need to ask if we could , in good conscience , continue to ... prop up his regime . " e-mail to a friend @entity1 's @entity191 contributed to this report .
