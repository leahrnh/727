( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , a eurozone behemoth , is in the crosshairs of @entity5 's financial crisis . the country is suffering from soaring borrowing costs , a banking system leaking cash and unemployment rates at devastating levels . @entity12 might be risking expulsion from the eurozone but @entity1 's situation is a focus of concern . if such a major economy were to fail , the repercussions could cause unprecedented havoc across @entity5 -- and the globe . just how bad is the pain in @entity1 ? on thursday , @entity1 will reveal its 2013 budget , which is expected to introduce harsh new austerity measures . reports have suggested they could match the potential requirements of a full sovereign bailout . according to @entity28 , @entity29 economist , " substantial efforts " will be required to meet a budget deficit target of 4.5 % . pension reforms are possible , such as fast - tracking plans to increase the retirement age to 67 from 65 , while taxation and labor markets could also be targeted , @entity28 noted . the budget is followed by friday 's release of the country 's banking audit , which is expected to reveal details of the sector 's financial needs . consensus sits at € 60 billion and " too low a number will raise concerns that there are more hidden losses to come -- all the more given the very frail economic backdrop , " @entity28 wrote in an analysis note . the audit follows an agreement by eurozone finance ministers in june to give aid to @entity1 , tagging up to € 100 billion to shore up its banking sector . at the time , @entity1 's prime minister , @entity56 , said the deal meant " @entity5 credibility won , the future of the euro won [ and ] @entity5 won . " the country has been facing credit issues after its financial problems were thrown into sharp relief by the bailout of @entity66 , the country 's fourth - largest bank . @entity66 was forced to call for € 19 billion ( $ 23.7 billion ) in assistance in may , panicking markets . it sent @entity1 's cost of borrowing ( for the sovereign 10 - year bond ) toward 7 % -- a level which is regarded as unsustainable and has precipitated bailouts of other euro countries . but @entity1 -- in its second recession since 2009 -- has been dubbed " too big to bail , too big to fail . " the @entity1 economy is the eurozone 's fourth - largest -- after @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 -- making up around 11 % of the bloc 's gdp . to put that in perspective , @entity12 , @entity86 and @entity87 -- the three eurozone countries which have already been bailed out -- combined make up less than 6 % of the bloc 's economy . a request for aid would likely create a backlash in the markets and test the @entity98 's plan to buy up sovereign bonds on the secondary market . how did @entity1 reach this point ? @entity1 's banking sector is facing up to years of bad investments , largely in real estate , which was buoyed by cheap credit and the country 's sunny climate . its housing boom - times of 2002 to 2008 were fed , in part , by retired north @entity5 buying up second houses in places such as @entity112 and @entity113 , according to political scientist @entity114 , of think - tank @entity115 . real estate prices have now fallen some 30 % to 50 % from their highs , leaving @entity1 's banks , or cajas with housing stock on their books whose current value is much lower than the original . meanwhile hundreds of thousands of houses built during the boom remain unsold , and people wanting to buy may find it difficult to get credit . @entity114 also points to the cajas ' politically - driven executive appointments as a contributing factor to the crisis . " many senior bankers were low - profile regional politicians or majors , without any financial experience or bank background , " he said . what has @entity1 done to try and sort through this mess ? the government set up the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) in 2009 , to help reorganize its banking sector , and has received international recognition for its efforts to date . according to april 's @entity148 report , the country has reduced the number of financial institutions from 45 to 11 . the report noted : " the authorities are , rightly , focusing on strengthening the banking sector . " it said the authorities were showing " an appropriate sense of urgency " but also warned that " unless the weak institutions are quickly and adequately cleaned up , the sound banks will suffer unnecessarily by a continued loss of market confidence in the banking sector . " as it stands , the banks have an estimated € 300 billion of problem loans on their books , with the full cost of recovery not yet clear . what other headaches does @entity1 face ? in addition to the financial sector 's problems , @entity1 could be liable for the debts of several regional governments , which have been hit with ratings downgrades . @entity1 also has an unemployment crisis , with more than half those under 24 out of work , and almost one in four people overall . @entity1 's jobless rate has helped pushed the eurozone 's total unemployment rate to 11 % -- its highest since the eurozone was created in 1999 . why is the economy collapsing now ? the situation in @entity1 has developed like a perfect storm , with money being pulled out of the country , despite the desperate need to stem capital flight and support its banking system . this leaves @entity1 in a precarious financial state , driving investors away , pushing up its borrowing costs and making it more likely to need a bailout . it 's a reminder of how governments are inextricably tied to their country 's banking systems , essentially the lifeblood of their economy . in @entity87 , the banking sector 's similar gorge on property forced the country to take a € 67.5 billion bailout in 2010 . the mood of the markets may , ultimately , dictate @entity1 's ability to pull itself from its financial hole . investors already twitchy about the prospect of a " @entity213 " -- a @entity12 exit from the euro -- will react badly to further bad news out of @entity1 . ratings agency @entity216 's has put the chance of @entity12 exiting the euro at around one in three , but says the impact of such an outcome on other countries is not yet clear . the struggles in @entity5 have been exacerbated by continued miserable news out of the @entity225 where does @entity226 stand when it comes to making cuts to public services ? @entity1 's emergence as the crisis epicenter has again fed debate over the value of austerity over stimulus . @entity12 , the first euro country to take a bailout , has been swallowing austerity medicine since 2010 . but its economy has slid further into recession , and initial hopes it could detach itself from external life - lines within two years now look wildly optimistic . @entity1 has also been implementing austerity measures to try and combat its crisis . @entity56 , who won a landslide victory over the @entity246 in november 2011 , focused on cost cutting and labor reforms . but , as with other fragile countries within the euro bloc , @entity1 's economy remains weak and its unemployment levels continue to rise . some @entity5 leaders are now voicing concerns against austerity measures and in the @entity225 , the @entity256 has moved towards more stimulus , with further quantitative easing . @entity260 's @entity259 , @entity261 and @entity262 , and @entity0 's @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .

but the situation in @placeholder is developing like a " perfect storm , " with money being pulled out of the country
