@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- violence and voter intimidation in @entity1 's eastern region has forced the displacement of thousands of ethnic @entity7 who support presidential candidate @entity9 , according to an official for the @entity11 in @entity1 and local officials of @entity9 's party . the @entity16 nation 's long - awaited , much - delayed second round presidential runoff between @entity9 and @entity17 is scheduled for sunday . but more than a week of violence and intimidation that has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the towns of @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 in eastern @entity1 has soured what would be the nation 's most credible democratic presidential vote in its 52 - year history . are you there ? share images and video with @entity35 @entity36 , head of media relations for the @entity11 in @entity38 , the nation 's capital , told @entity2 on tuesday that 2,800 people were displaced on october 29 and 30 alone . in addition , commercial trucks filled with ethnic @entity42 and all their possessions have been leaving the eastern towns of @entity24 ( about 800 kilometers from @entity38 ) and @entity25 ( about 580 kilometers from @entity38 ) every day for the past 12 days , and local officials for @entity9 's @entity48 party say a total of 15,000 to 20,000 @entity42 have been displaced around the country . most of the displaced people have traveled west to the @entity55 region , where they have relatives , the officials say . after a rally for @entity60 in @entity38 on october 22 in which dozens of supporters fell sick after drinking contaminated water and yogurt , ethnic @entity58 people attacked @entity42 in @entity1 , especially in @entity24 and @entity25 , for days . those displaced spoke of @entity58 men looting and burning @entity42 - owned businesses and demolishing homes where @entity7 lived in @entity24 . officials for @entity9 's party said they registered the deaths of three @entity42 in @entity24 , one who had been fatally beaten and two who had died after being struck by stones . @entity17 , whose father is from the @entity58 ethnic group , draws much of his support from the majority @entity58 region of @entity1 , where most of the violence happened . @entity9 , an ethnic @entity42 , has his base of supporters in the northwestern @entity55 region . @entity82 , the campaign director for the @entity48 party in @entity0 , a town on the border of the @entity55 and @entity1 regions where many @entity42 have stayed or passed through , said the violence seemed planned . " they do n't want [ the @entity42 ] to vote and we heard that they even put out a communique on local radio saying that if [ the @entity42 ] stay there until election day they will kill all of them , " @entity82 told @entity2 on monday . " we estimate that 15 to 20,000 people have passed through or stayed in @entity0 " since october 22 , " he added . " @entity93 told us that meetings had been organized , and razors and knives distributed to get rid of the @entity42 by force . " one displaced man said those who forced them out made no secret of the reason . " they told us , ' come election day not a single @entity42 will vote here , ' which is why they chased us away , " said @entity103 , who left @entity24 with his family and all their belongings and was heading for his village of origin in the @entity55 region . and a displaced @entity42 woman traveling from @entity24 who asked not to be named for safety reasons told a similar story . " they gave out a list of people from the @entity42 ethnic group and said that they have to leave before the election or they will be killed , " she said . @entity82 said the authorities in @entity24 and @entity25 , members of a military junta who has ruled @entity1 since december , 2008 , did not do anything to stop the violence . " we are under the impression that the authorities are complicit . otherwise how can there be such trouble for four , five days without the authorities intervening , " he said . @entity131 , a @entity58 businessman in @entity132 , an upper @entity1 city some 120 kilometers from @entity24 , told @entity2 that @entity134 violence had spread to @entity132 but had been contained because of local peace efforts . @entity38 supporters of @entity17 's rpg party " called us to say that [ the @entity42 ] poisoned @entity137 members . ... everyone wanted to destroy everything here , but we reasoned with them and made them understand that it is our country and @entity1 belongs to everyone , so they left them alone , " @entity131 said . dr. @entity148 , professor at @entity149 in @entity150 and author of a book on @entity1 's independence leader , told @entity2 recently that " ethnicity becomes truly a problem when politicians resort to it to compensate for their lack of viable ideological platform and political program to meaningfully mobilize the electorate . " the number of displaced people has once again complicated efforts to hold a credible second round of presidential elections . @entity166 , the retired @entity167 general in charge of @entity1 's electoral commission , told journalists at a press conference on monday that the government was taking measures to ensure that those displaced will be able to vote . but with thousands of displaced people now in remote villages with electoral cards left behind in @entity24 and @entity25 , it will be very difficult for the inefficient @entity179 government to reach all those affected . " we are very scared because this is a dangerous precedent , a very dangerous precedent , " @entity82 said . " if people who have lived in a place for 30 years , 40 years , 50 years , are told to leave the houses they have built , the businesses filled with their goods , it 's really quite worrying . "
