the chilling images from @entity1 brought back memories from one of the most disturbing and important moments of none other than @entity7 's tactics for establishing his iron - clad rule of @entity9 . the young @entity1 leader , @entity11 , it appears , has learned from the most ruthless and long - lasting of modern dictators . on monday , @entity1 's citizens saw what would have seemed impossible just a few months ago : the man who had stood at @entity11 's side since he came to power , his uncle @entity15 , publicly humiliated in a shake - up that signaled a fierce power struggle and sent a stern message to the country and the world . the televised footage showed what unfolded during the meeting of the party 's @entity26 , reportedly the day before . in a room of stunned party members , two uniformed soldiers grabbed @entity15 -- until recently the country 's second most powerful man -- and took him away after he was accused of betraying @entity11 and the revolution . just a few days later , on thursday , the @entity1 government - controlled @entity34 reported that @entity15 had been executed for betraying the regime : " despicable human scum @entity15 , who was worse than a dog , perpetrated thrice - cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for him . " decades - old grainy black and white images from @entity9 tell a similar story of power and intrigue whose consequences are now well - known . on july 22 , 1979 , during a meeting of @entity9 's @entity56 , the names of 60 top party leaders labeled traitors were read as , one by one , the terrified men were removed from the hall . that footage was also distributed widely -- a sign to all that @entity7 would let no one stand in his way , instilling fear even among the most powerful in the country . it was a moment that as much as any other cemented @entity7 's rule for almost a quarter of a century . in keeping with the totalitarians ' textbook , the @entity1 regime denounced @entity11 's uncle in language that would be familiar to those who have lived under the worst dictatorships . the masterpiece of totalitarian prose , published for all to read in the state media , accused @entity15 of leading a " dissolute and depraved life . " it condemns him for pretending to support @entity11 while " dreaming different dreams , " and living a life of corruption , ambition , drug use , " wining and dining at back parlors and deluxe restaurants , " as well as " gambling in foreign casinos at the party 's expense " and being " affected by the capitalist way of living . " @entity11 's uncle , the regime charges , was " behaving against the elementary sense of moral obligation and conscience of a human being . " most of all , @entity15 -- married to the sister of @entity11 's late father , former leader @entity101 -- is accused of planning to challenge his nephew and undermine him as " unitary center " of the state . it 's a stunning ledger of charges and one that makes no effort to conceal there is a power struggle in @entity1 . tellingly , the accusations speak of a @entity15 " group , " which suggests the purge is far from over . there have already been reports that a couple of @entity15 associates were executed . state media has followed the reports with a scrubbing of the files . @entity15 is being erased from the records . the man who stood at @entity11 's side when his father died is being photoshopped out of existence . all mentions of him -- except for the condemnations -- are disappearing from the website of the @entity34 . and every photograph is now suddenly , and not - so - mysteriously , free of his image . he has even been deleted from a recent documentary about @entity11 . the question is what comes next : what does this mean for the millions of @entity1 living under @entity11 's brutal rule ? how does this execution and purge affect nuclear - armed @entity1 's behavior on the global stage ? @entity15 was known as something of a reformer , although that term must be viewed within the context of the totalitarian regime . he supported limited market reforms and reportedly opposed @entity147 's nuclear test earlier this year -- both positions that put him at odds with the military . there is little doubt that @entity15 's execution strengthens the military 's hand . the experience from @entity9 suggests that a reign of fear among the powerful serves only to entrench the harshest policies . high - ranking officials , worried about appearing weak or disloyal , will be more reluctant to suggest reforms that loosen the regime 's grip . that is dismal news for those who live in a state that is the world 's worst violator of human rights . a new report from @entity172 says as many as 200,000 @entity1 , including children , the elderly and generations of families live in prison camps where they routinely endure torture , starvation and worse . life outside the camps is also subject to harsh conditions for most @entity1 . when the younger @entity11 came to power in 2011 after his father died , some held hope that his time living in @entity189 had instilled reformist instincts , expecting he would moderate domestic policies and undertake more conciliatory actions toward the rest of the world . but so far , he has proven as defiant and inflexible as his father and grandfather . in a major crisis a year ago , he launched long - range missiles and later detonated a nuclear weapon and then threatened a nuclear attack against the @entity201 and @entity202 . @entity11 may now want to prevent anyone from taking advantage of turmoil in @entity147 with another show of force . it is not clear what exactly caused the high - level purge . the military might have triggered and won the clash with @entity15 . some suggest @entity11 may now be a figurehead in a military - led regime , but he already reshuffled the military command . he appears to be in control . more likely , however , @entity11 is consolidating power , much like @entity7 did in 1979 . he is building his own inner circle of trustworthy loyalists and daring anyone to defy him . the young heir who rose to power two years ago under the protection of an experienced uncle is sending notice that he is not a child any more . the dictator is all grown up and settling in for a long time in power .

@entity239 : @placeholder 's uncle was accused of living in depravity ; now , the military is in charge
