( @entity0 ) -- i know you 've got the major risks in your financial life well taken care of : your 401 ( k ) is properly diversified to help you weather market volatility , and your reserve cash fund is on call to cover life 's inevitable emergencies . good work ! but i 'm worried about your financial blind spots -- those pesky threats to your security that lurk behind seemingly sound decisions . here are a few common traps , and advice to ensure that you wo n't get taken by surprise : perils of plastic good news : you 've sworn off credit cards . goodbye insane interest rates and fees ! you 're sticking with your debit card from now on . hidden risk : debit card transactions are n't reported to the credit bureaus , so if you do n't use a credit card , you 'll have less of a payment history -- which hurts your fico credit score . how to stay on top : i love , love , love that you want to use your debit card . but to keep your credit score solid , you still need to keep a few credit cards and use them at least once every few months . even if you think you 'll never need to borrow again , your fico credit score has a big impact . it can affect your auto insurance premium and whether a landlord will rent to you , and many employers even check it when vetting a job application . cards issued by credit unions typically charge lower rates ( generally limited to a max of 18 percent ) and fewer fees . check out @entity51 to find the best options . @entity0 : how to deal with credit card debt the bond issues good news : you 're sleeping better than ever since you moved all your retirement money out of stocks and into bonds . hidden risk : you 're approaching two land mines here . first up is inflation . make it to age 65 and there 's a good chance you 'll live another 20 years or longer . ( more on this in the next item . ) over a 20 - year period , a 4 percent average inflation rate ( the historical norm since the ' 50s ) will reduce the purchasing power of today 's dollar to about 50 cents . that will make it very hard to maintain your standard of living in retirement . bonds are n't an ideal inflation hedge , since their historical returns are typically not much better than the inflation rate . making matters worse , because of the financial crisis and the @entity85 's efforts to keep the economy growing , bond yields are at unprecedented lows . this is not a permanent situation . soon -- maybe this year or next -- interest rates , and thus bond yields , will start to rise . when rates rise , the market price of bonds falls . that hurts your portfolio . how to stay on top : every portfolio benefits from bonds ; they provide a cushion when the stock market hits a rough patch . but avoiding stocks completely could mean your investment wo n't grow any faster than the rate of inflation . as a general rule , your age is a good guideline for the percentage of bonds you want -- if you 're 55 , put 55 percent in bonds and 45 percent in stocks . if you 're worried about putting money in stocks right now , stick with mutual funds or exchange - traded funds ( @entity118 ) that focus on dividend - paying stocks . the dividend payout is a steady stream of income , much like a bond , and right now the yield on some dividend portfolios is actually higher than the yield on a five - year treasury bond . while dividend stocks have their own risk , if you have time on your side -- at least ten years -- you can pocket that nice dividend income today , ride out the volatility , and , over the long term , potentially earn inflation - beating gains . @entity0 : how to go green on the stock market live long -- and prosper ? how to enjoy a long , comfortable retirement good news : you 're likely to reach a much older age than women of previous generations . today a woman of 65 will probably live 20 more years -- 60 percent longer than her life expectancy in 1900 . hidden risk : that means more years that your 401 ( k ) and @entity146 need to support you . how to stay on top : to enjoy a long , comfortable retirement , save more today . if you 're 50 or older , take advantage of the catch - up provisions : instead of an annual 401 ( k ) max of $ 16,500 in 2010 , you 're entitled to invest $ 22,000 , and your @entity146 limit rises from the standard $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 . you may also want to retire later . working until 67 or 70 gives those funds more time to grow -- which gives you more security . you do n't have to keep the high - powered career you have now ; a less demanding job will still bring in valuable income . retirement loans : on borrowed dimes good news : you 're in a pinch , but your company allows you to borrow from your 401 ( k ) . hidden risk : make that plural -- there are three problems with taking your company up on that loan . first , if you leave your job , voluntarily or not , you 'll typically have only a few months to pay back what you 've borrowed . if you ca n't , the loan converts to a withdrawal on which you 'll owe income tax , and if you 're under 55 you 'll also be hit with a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty . second , when you pull money out of any investment , it 's no longer working for your future . anyone who took a loan from their 401 ( k ) in early 2009 missed out when the @entity188 stock index shot up more than 60 percent from march to december . that was a costly time to be out of the market . third , your loan money will end up being taxed twice -- when you repay the loan it will be with after - tax dollars , and then in retirement , when you begin using your 401 ( k ) for living expenses , you 'll be responsible for the tax due on those withdrawals . how to stay on top : make a 401 ( k ) loan an absolute last resort . a well - maintained emergency savings fund is a far better insurance policy against unforeseen expenses . as you know , i advise saving up eight months of living expenses -- especially now , when most unemployed people need at least six months to find a new job . kids need the darndest things good news : you 're expecting , or you have young kids . hidden risk : you may not be providing enough security for your family if something happens to you . how to stay on top : you ca n't control fate , but you absolutely , positively can make sure that your children will be financially secure , no matter what . a term life insurance policy that 's at least 15 times your annual income will give your kids ' guardian plenty of money to raise them according to your wishes . i know that sounds like a lot , but these policies are remarkably inexpensive . @entity0 : discover the pleasures of pinching pennies shaky foundations good news : the steep decline in home prices means you can afford to buy your first home . hidden risk : it 's easy to underestimate the real cost of home ownership . how to stay on top : property tax , insurance , and maintenance can add 30 percent to your base mortgage . to see how that extra expense will affect you , plug in your price range for a home at @entity252 to determine your monthly mortgage payment , and then add 30 percent to that figure . if the total is more than your current rent , spend six months " playing house " -- each month , deposit the difference between your rent and your probable mortgage payment into a separate savings account . if you ca n't afford this exercise , you ca n't afford to buy a home at that price just yet . and do n't forget : before buying a home , you must have an emergency fund that can cover your expenses for eight months . if anything happens to your job or a big expense pops up , you 'll need to have the cash to pay the mortgage . finally , do n't buy if there 's any chance you 'll move within five to seven years . if you sell a newly purchased house , you risk making too little on the sale to cover the typical 6 percent agent 's fee and your moving costs . i know the housing market 's rock - bottom prices are tempting , but it 's better to be safe than sorry . by @entity285 from @entity286 , @entity284 © 2010 subscribe to @entity286 , @entity284 for up to 75 % off the newsstand price . that 's like getting 18 issues free . subscribe now ! @entity291 @entity290 , @entity292 .
