( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , unyielding and violent reality is beginning to confront the @entity4 political establishment with facts from which it can not hide . for 35 years , since @entity7 seized the @entity8 on november 4 , 1979 , and kept the @entity4 in it as hostages , the @entity4 has been at war with radical @entity11 . they knew it . we hid from it . year after year since then , radical islamists have grown more militant , more sophisticated and more numerous . now , in an arc of terror from @entity19 in @entity20 through @entity21 in @entity22 to @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , there is a clear wave of vicious religious warfare being waged against civilization by fanatics who openly promise and engage in genocidal killing . to understand why i link @entity23 , @entity21 and @entity19 , consider the language of their own statements . why not take them at their word ? @entity23 has made its murderous intentions painfully clear . it has proven in town after town that it will force people to convert to @entity11 or it will kill them in numbers that are now being called genocidal . as president @entity46 said in his speech thursday night , " many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out . " the group has also made clear that it views its mission as a worldwide war . " i say to @entity4 that the @entity11 caliphate has been established , " a spokesman for the group said thursday . he warned that the group will attack @entity4 and " will raise the flag of @entity56 in the @entity57 . " " do n't be cowards and attack us with drones , " he said . " instead send your soldiers , the ones we humiliated in @entity24 . we will humiliate them everywhere . " its actions give us no choice but to acknowledge that @entity23 means what it says . many people seem to be confused or deluded into believing that @entity21 does not have similarly genocidal intentions . its charter is a useful starting point . " @entity72 will rise and will remain erect until @entity11 eliminates it as it had eliminated its predecessors , " it says . what does " eliminate " mean , you might ask ? more from the charter : " ... [ t ] he @entity21 has been looking forward to implement @entity56 's promise whatever time it might take . the prophet , prayer and peace be upon him , said : the time will not come until @entity86 will fight the @entity87 ( and kill them ) ; until the @entity87 hide behind rocks and trees , which will cry : @entity90 ! there is a jew hiding behind me , come on and kill him ! " as @entity4 and @entity96 beg for cease - fires , it is useful to see @entity21 ' attitude toward such arrangements . from " @entity100 : @entity101 " : " [ @entity103 ] initiatives , the so - called peaceful solutions , and the international conferences to resolve the @entity107 problem , are all contrary to the beliefs of the @entity21 . for renouncing any part of @entity110 means renouncing part of the religion ... the movement educates its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner of @entity56 over their homeland as they fight their @entity118 . ... " there is no solution to the @entity107 problem except by @entity118 , " it concludes . " the initiatives , proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time , an exercise in futility . the @entity107 people are too noble to have their future , their right and their destiny submitted to a vain game . " of course , the charter of @entity21 was written in 1988 , so maybe they have mellowed ? during this current struggle , while @entity135 were begging the @entity72 to be reasonable , an imam amplified @entity21 ' position in a public , televised sermon . " our doctrine in fighting you [ the @entity87 ] is that we will totally exterminate you . we will not leave a single one of you alive , because you are alien usurpers of the land and eternal mercenaries . " obviously the organization exists for the same genocidal mission as @entity23 . @entity19 has its own contribution to this hateful movement . a spokesman for @entity19 recently told a @entity20 newspaper that " the @entity20 state and @entity151 are our enemies and we will be launching attacks on the @entity20 state and its security apparatus as well as churches until we achieve our goal of establishing an @entity11 state in place of the secular state . " @entity19 threatened its captured @entity162 girls with death or being sold into slavery if they did n't convert to @entity11 . @entity23 is saying the same thing to the @entity167 girls they are capturing . the civilized world faces an existential challenge to its very right to exist . this violent , genocidal ideology holds more territory today than at any time in modern history . from @entity20 to @entity24 , the challenge is being organized by sincere , serious fanatics motivated by religion and willing , indeed eager , to die for their cause . @entity135 elites are terrified of confronting this reality . for years they have refused to take these people at their word , and millions of @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity20 , @entity26 , @entity107 and @entity72 , among many others , are paying the price . president @entity46 's speech thursday night was a pathetic , shallow , sophistic excuse for a serious conversation with the @entity4 people . @entity4 are not " war weary . " but even if we were , it would not matter . the alternative is the victory of genocidal murdering religious fanatics over enormous territory that they pledge to use to attack the @entity4 . a president 's job is to explain this . president @entity200 carried @entity4 through an extraordinarily painful civil war by telling the truth , admitting mistakes and reminding @entity4 what was at stake . the elites in both political parties have refused to confront how serious , brutal and determined our enemies are . the @entity210 is the second most dysfunctional federal department after the @entity211 because its culture and structure force it to mislead and misinform every president . thirteen years after 9/11 , at a cost of thousands of lives , tens of thousands of wounded , and trillions of dollars , the @entity4 is weaker and our enemies are stronger . this is not an @entity46 problem . this is an @entity4 problem . we need a new honest conversation on how we as a free people are going to defeat the forces of evil who stalk the planet . join us on @entity229 / @entity228 .
