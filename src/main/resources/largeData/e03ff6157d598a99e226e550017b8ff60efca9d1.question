@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- nineteen - year - old @entity3 is on her knees at home , whispering her prayers . it 's a small sign of normality in a community where things have been anything but normal in recent months . this young @entity13 woman ca n't go inside her family 's mosque because it was shut down after being vandalized . and for more than a month , she had to say her prayers from inside a shelter at a nearby sports stadium in @entity0 , a city in central @entity1 . fearing for their lives , @entity3 's family fled their home on march 20 during the first of three days of rioting that tore apart this city of 100,000 people . a wave of sectarian violence between @entity30 and @entity13 resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people and displaced thousands more , according to the @entity1 government . during the clashes , reportedly set off by a dispute between a @entity13 gold shop owner and two @entity39 sellers , rioters set fire to houses , schools and mosques , while people were also beaten , doused with gasoline and set on fire . many @entity13 complain that the police stood by and did nothing during the violence . the rioting was only stopped after president @entity51 declared a state of emergency and called in the military . by then thousands had fled their homes in terror . @entity0 's muslims were heavily outnumbered and suffered the bulk of the casualties . few remained in their homes because they were either destroyed by rampaging mobs or it simply was n't safe for them to stay there . it was n't until earlier this month that @entity13 whose houses were not destroyed were able to leave the shelters and return home . " @entity69 came out of my eyes when i got back home , " said @entity3 's mother , @entity68 . " i 'm extremely happy to be back home . " but the 43 - year old said that when she walks down the streets of this predominantly @entity39 city , it 's clear things are not the way they were before the riots . " we ( @entity13 and @entity30 ) do n't interact with each other the way we used too , " she said . " people are keeping a mental distance between each other . " @entity68 and her extended family share a collection of rickety houses along a side street in a modest neighborhood of @entity0 . a security post manned by police and soldiers has been set up just a short walk away . similar arrangements are in place in other parts of the city where @entity13 live -- a sign of the times since march . " there are soldiers and security guards on each end of the street , " @entity68 said , before adding that she hopes they can keep her family safe . but in areas that bore the brunt of the rioting , little has been rebuilt more than two months on . the blackened frames of burned down homes are all that stand in some places . metal sheets that once served as roofs now lie in pieces on the ashen ground . the government says it will replace all of the approximately 1,600 homes that were destroyed -- an easier task than repairing the trust between @entity13 and @entity30 . " right now we do n't trust them and they do n't trust us , " said @entity120 , a 50 - year - old @entity39 man . @entity120 is married with five kids between the ages of five and 24 . he says he has numerous @entity13 friends , but things have been strained since the riots . " after this we do n't really have to talk . it is n't necessary for us to talk with each other at all , " he said . " i 'm afraid to trust them right now . " he said he used to buy meat from a @entity13 butcher but wo n't now because he 's afraid his food might be poisoned . meanwhile , @entity68 's family says they 're playing it safe by buying their food from other @entity13 . she has also instructed her daughter to stay close to home . she 's a student at a local university that has not reopened since the riots . @entity3 says she has several @entity39 friends at school and is hoping her relationships with them go back to normal . but she has n't contacted them since the violence and they have n't been in touch with her . though @entity1 is about 90 % @entity39 , @entity13 have generally coexisted peacefully with the @entity39 majority -- their children go to school together and their parents often work together . but as with @entity0 , ethnic fault lines have been exposed in some areas as the country emerges from decades of military repression . last year , at least 110 people were killed in attacks on muslims in western @entity1 's @entity162 . the @entity164 people are a stateless @entity13 minority living in @entity162 -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they were persecuted by @entity1 's military during its decades of authoritarian rule . @entity1 does not recognize them as citizens or as one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country . much of this is rooted in their heritage in @entity177 , now called @entity178 . though many @entity180 have only known life in @entity1 , they are viewed by the @entity39 majority as intruders from across the border . across the country , a budding movement known as " 969 " has been spreading @entity187 sentiment by encouraging @entity30 to avoid @entity13 - run businesses . " 969 " stickers are increasingly found in businesses and taxis in @entity192 , the country 's largest and most ethnically diverse city . police recently stepped up patrols in @entity192 following the @entity0 clashes , though serious fighting has yet to spread there . however , in several communities within 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) of @entity192 , @entity39 mobs reportedly vandalized mosques as well as @entity13 businesses and houses . the wave of religious unrest has prompted the 57 - nation @entity205 ( @entity205 ) urge @entity1 authorities to allow a delegation to visit @entity1 to discuss the issue -- a request the authorities in @entity211 have so far rebuffed .
