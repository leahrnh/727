@entity0 , @entity1 . ( @entity2 ) -- try as it might , @entity3 could n't pull off its own miracle , having suffered the ultimate @entity6 indignity two years ago at @entity7 in @entity8 when leading 10 - 6 going into sunday . led by its talisman @entity9 -- the world number one -- @entity11 saw off a brave challenge from those in red to retain the trophy by a ultimately comfortable margin of 16½ - 11½ . it was the continent 's third straight victory , its sixth in the last seven and one that provoked searching questions for @entity22 captain @entity21 , not least from his star player @entity23 . but " @entity23 " is also facing some questions after he was accused of throwing his " captain right under the bus , " by former @entity28 skipper @entity27 . @entity21 's @entity28 counterpart @entity31 will be subject to no such inquisition , universally lauded by his players and serenaded by a vibrant @entity1 crowd once his triumph was rubber - stamped . rookie triumphs rookie @entity37 secured the clinching point by beating @entity39 , and was promptly enveloped on the 15th green by cameramen , photographers and his wife , not to mention a jubilant @entity28 team . " i ca n't really put it into words , " @entity37 , from @entity45 , said . " it 's unbelievable . there is nothing like it in golf . the @entity6 is just a total one off and it 's amazing to be a part of it . " before him @entity58 's @entity57 had overturned a three - hole deficit to topple rookie @entity60 2 & 1 while @entity9 's 5 & 4 takedown of @entity62 had a brutal edge to it . " early in the match , the trending was exactly where we wanted it to go , " @entity21 told reporters . " we had a lot of red scored up there . the players responded early , we just could n't keep it going . " the bottom line is they kicked our butts . they were better players this week . " @entity23 speaks out @entity21 was then forced to defend his own methods during a tense press conference after thinly veiled criticism from @entity23 , the five - time major champion , who has won on just two of his ten @entity6 appearances . the last of those came in 2008 and ' @entity23 ' praised the approach of then captain @entity85 , who he said had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a " real game plan . " @entity21 responded by saying : " ( @entity23 ) has a difference of opinion . that 's okay . my management philosophy is different than his . i had a different philosophy than @entity31 . i decided not to go that way . " @entity23 's comments drew withering criticism from former @entity100 player and @entity102 analyst @entity101 , who labeled the five - timer major winner as a golfer who had " corrupted the experience of the @entity6 . " @entity101 added : " that was as close to a one - man mutiny as i ever seen . " there was no such acrimony in the @entity28 press conference , @entity37 being spirited into it on the back of @entity113 , which was punctuated by the regular sound of champagne corks popping . asked to describe his sense of achievement , @entity31 said : " @entity119 is the first word . i want to say as captain it has been a real honor to get these 12 players , they have all been @entity125 . " foursomes dominance in truth , @entity31 's men had wrested the @entity6 decisively away from the @entity22 on saturday afternoon , thanks to a dominant @entity28 performance in the foursomes . and while both camps paid lip service to the miracle possibility before taking to the fairways on sunday , there would be no second successive seismic turnaround . the jubilant air around @entity0 confirmed that few in blue considered an upset feasible , 2010 @entity142 champion @entity57 roared off by a crowd that had been entertaining themselves in song long before the first ball had been addressed . for several hours the first tee box was the epicenter of world golf , 18 - time major champion @entity151 and former @entity153 manager @entity152 -- the most successful manager in the history of @entity157 soccer -- both present . unlikely prospect and though the task was tall , the @entity22 requiring eight - and - a - half points to pull off an unlikely victory , a few hours into the contest it led in five matches . heeding @entity21 's call to " smoke ' em early " , @entity60 raced into a three - hole lead over @entity57 , the 2010 @entity142 champion from @entity58 . behind him , the other standout @entity22 rookie , @entity169 , also advanced into an early lead over @entity172 's @entity171 . @entity173 , who succumbed in the crucial match at the climax of the @entity176 , birdied four of the opening six holes to seize the initiative in his clash with @entity180 , from @entity157 . but as he had promised prior to the competition , four - time major winner @entity9 proved he was the fulcrum in @entity11 's engine - room . birdie burst five birdies in six holes took him five clear of @entity62 , and in effect , sealed the outcome of their tussle before they had even reached the ninth hole . for an hour or so , that lone sliver of blue on the leaderboard was engulfed by red . slowly , the tide began to turn . @entity194 , the reigning @entity142 champion from @entity195 , took advantage of a wayward opening from @entity198 , the two - time @entity198 champion . @entity199 and @entity200 forged ahead in the early stages of their matches , while @entity171 was chewing away at the lead of @entity169 . but the top match was symptomatic of @entity22 fortunes , as @entity57 recovered from his stuttering start and stealthily set about hauling in @entity60 . trailing by three going down the tenth , the man who had been serenaded by @entity28 fans with with a chorus of " you 've got @entity213 , we 've got @entity215 , " before teeing off , found his stride . inspired play an inspired stretch of four birdies , acquired through a combination of formidable iron play and accurate putting , meant a symbolic switch from red to blue at the top of the leaderboard . it galvanized those behind him . @entity230 now roared back with four straight birdies of his own and ended with half a point against @entity173 . roars populated the course as the majority of the 40,000 - strong crowd grew in energy and belief , fans glued to the big screens when there was no action to be seen in front of them . @entity57 ended @entity60 's challenge on the 17th , and though @entity169 won the last to see off @entity171 , @entity194 's chip - in in front of huge crowds on 16 sealed another point . @entity23 carved out a win over home favorite @entity253 , while @entity255 holed out from 160 yards on his way to a comprehensive win over @entity258 's @entity113 . but further down the leaderboard , @entity37 had assumed complete control of his battle with @entity39 , the 2011 @entity22 pga champion . crowds gathered as it became clear the @entity265 was most likely to be the one to retain the trophy , crowds scampered up to the 14th green and jostled for position as @entity37 stood over his ball . though that one did n't drop , but glory was n't far away . a pitch perfect iron shot on the next hole landed barely two feet from the cup and once @entity39 got down to the green he conceded . following that decisive moment , @entity276 's @entity199 broke down on the 17th green after beating @entity279 , @entity200 and @entity280 halved their match , while rookie @entity283 got the better of @entity284 to win another point for @entity3 . it was left to @entity287 to strike the final blow of the @entity289 as he holed out to secure a half from @entity292 rookie @entity291 . with handshakes exchanged , @entity291 was engulfed by his teammates , as a sea of champagne spray kickstarted a @entity28 party that is set to endure for another two years at least .
