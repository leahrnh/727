( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 apologized friday to @entity3 for a 2010 raid on a @entity6 - bound flotilla , both nations said , signaling a potential major thaw after three years of chilly relations between the two key @entity11 nations . the @entity2 leader phoned his @entity3 counterpart , @entity13 , while sitting with @entity15 president @entity14 in a trailer on a @entity18 airport tarmac . in the call -- which @entity3 's foreign minister said lasted for nearly 30 minutes -- @entity1 acknowledged " operational mistakes " during the raid , which ended with eight @entity3 and an @entity15 of @entity3 origin dead . " ( @entity1 ) made it clear that the tragic results regarding the @entity26 were unintentional and that @entity2 expresses regret over injuries and loss of life , " the @entity2 government said . @entity13 accepted the apology , which came shortly after he talked with the leaders of @entity34 and @entity35 . @entity3 foreign minister @entity36 said later on state tv , according to the semiofficial @entity39 news agency , that all @entity3 's demands had been met . it was n't immediately clear what impact the conversation might have on a region that is already home to numerous crises -- such as the deadly , two - year - long civil war in @entity48 and tensions over @entity51 's nuclear programs . at the least , the movement toward mending a rift between two of @entity56 's top allies appeared to be a boon for @entity14 , who said he 's been appealing to @entity1 and @entity13 " for the last two years " for them to fix " this rupture . " " there are obviously going to still be some significant disagreements ... but they also have a wide range of shared interests , and they both happen to be extraordinarily strong partners and friends of ours , " @entity14 said at a press conference with @entity63 's @entity62 " so it 's in the interest of the @entity15 that they begin this process of getting their relationship back in order . " ' an important step ' while there was little public indication ahead of a time that there would be a breakthrough thursday , @entity36 said it actually came after three years of tough negotiations . the talks picked up steam in the past week , spurred by @entity15 secretary of state @entity89 and other officials , the @entity3 foreign minister added . on thursday , @entity14 said he talked with @entity1 about his reaching out to @entity13 , " and both of us agreed that the moment was right . " the @entity15 president at one point got on the call between the two @entity11 leaders , said two senior administration officials who labeled the call " an important step " in normalizing @entity3 - @entity2 ties . " during my visit , it appeared that the timing was good for that conversation to take place , " @entity14 said , without elaborating . @entity3 and @entity2 have been two pro-western political , economic , and military linchpins in the @entity11 , and their falling out has hurt initiatives to tackle problems in the region , such as the @entity48 civil war and tensions relating to @entity51 's nuclear aspirations . a @entity115 member of @entity116 , @entity3 long had been @entity2 's most significant @entity115 friend , and the deterioration of relations between the two nations intensified the jewish state 's isolation in the region , more unstable in light of the @entity125 and other ferment in the @entity11 . @entity13 's critical rhetoric toward @entity2 policies in @entity6 have been hailed by many in the @entity131 world . it 's not clear when and if such steps as fully normalizing relations and returning ambassadors to their posts will be taken . earlier @entity2 had sent out a statement saying those steps had been agreed upon , but it later amended its statement by removing those points . there also was no word on whether the once - close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the @entity26 incident . @entity3 had been prosecuting four @entity2 soldiers in absentia , and @entity2 initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops . later , however , its amended statement omitted that action as well . agreeing to work together in thursday 's conversation , @entity13 told @entity1 that he thought the deterioration of ties between the countries was regrettable , especially given " the shared history and centuries old ties of strong friendship and cooperation between the @entity162 and @entity3 peoples . " according to a statement released by the @entity3 government , @entity13 discussed with his @entity2 counterpart the " importance of a just , lasting and comprehensive resolution of the @entity168 on the basis of the two - state vision . " the two leaders " agreed to work together to improve the humanitarian situation in the @entity174 territories , " the @entity3 statement said . the @entity2 government said in a statement the two sides would " work to improve the humanitarian situation in the @entity174 territories , " with @entity1 noting @entity2 has " substantially lifted the restrictions " on entry of civilian goods into @entity6 . helping the @entity174 people had long been a concern for @entity3 , and was the reason ostensibly that the flotilla set sail for @entity6 in the first place . @entity2 long has voiced concerns about arms smuggling to @entity6 militants intent on attacking the jewish state . @entity6 is controlled by @entity191 , an anti-israel group regarded as a terrorist organization by the @entity15 and @entity2 . but activists say @entity2 's embargo of goods into @entity6 from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the @entity202 coast . @entity2 has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to @entity6 can do so in coordination with @entity2 authorities via existing land crossings into the @entity174 territory . all that said , the highlight of the conversation dealt with the 2009 raid . @entity2 has long stood by the operation , though its tune publicly changed friday . " in light of @entity2 's investigation into the incident , which pointed out several operational mistakes , prime minister @entity1 expressed @entity2 's apology to the @entity3 people for any mistakes that might have led to loss of life or injury and agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation / nonliability , " the @entity2 government said . asked to confirm whether @entity1 called and apologized and offered compensation , as @entity231 had long demanded , a senior @entity3 official told @entity0 : " yes . " @entity13 only said they " agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation / nonliability . " one @entity174 - @entity2 lawmaker does n't like it @entity236 , a @entity174 activist who was on the @entity26 and also is a @entity174 member of @entity2 's parliament , said she does not accept @entity1 's apology . she wants an international court to try the people " involved in the political decision that gave a green light to kill the political activists on the @entity26 . " she said @entity1 's push to improve @entity2 - @entity3 ties is undermining the @entity174 ' demands -- such as ending @entity2 occupation of the @entity249 and the @entity2 military and economic strictures on @entity6 . she said @entity1 is trying to evade that and other issues . " the issue is not only @entity26 , @entity26 was the small crime . the big crime was the siege on @entity6 , " she told @entity0 . @entity258 -- a spokeswoman for @entity259 , the @entity115 aid agency that operated the @entity26 = = called the apology " a positive political development . " " but in terms of the need for the blockade on @entity6 to end and in terms of the ongoing case to punish those who are responsible for the crimes committed during the raid , the legal process will continue , " she said , referring to the case against the soldiers . @entity275 , a @entity3 political analyst and former parliamentarian from @entity13 's party , said the apology is important because it shows " to the world that there is a political price to kill @entity3 citizens in international waters . " " probably in the @entity11 , as well , it will be seen as political victory for the @entity13 government . but what matters more is the normalization itself , the obvious benefits to @entity3 and @entity2 as well as the @entity174 . " the prospect of an @entity2 - @entity3 reconciliation is bad news , @entity275 said , for @entity48 president @entity294 and @entity51 . " as @entity48 is entering into its third year of uprising , @entity231 and @entity18 will have to coordinate policy and may need to work together to contain potential risks to both countries , " he said . @entity0 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity302 contributed to this report
