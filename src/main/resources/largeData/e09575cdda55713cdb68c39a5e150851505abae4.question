( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 is more than just a three - day weekend and a chance to get the year 's first sunburn . here 's a handy 10 - pack of facts to give the holiday some perspective . the gravesite of capt. @entity8 is seen in @entity9 . 1 . it started with the @entity11 @entity1 was a response to the unprecedented carnage of the @entity11 , in which some 620,000 soldiers on both sides died . the loss of life and its effect on communities throughout the @entity19 led to spontaneous commemorations of the dead : in 1864 , women from @entity23 , @entity24 , put flowers on the graves of their dead from the just - fought @entity27 . the next year , a group of women decorated the graves of soldiers buried in a @entity34 , @entity33 , cemetery . in april 1866 , women from @entity36 , @entity33 , laid flowers on the graves of both @entity38 and @entity40 soldiers . it was recognized at the time as an act of healing regional wounds . in the same month , up in @entity45 , @entity46 , 219 @entity11 veterans marched through town in memory of the fallen to @entity49 , where @entity38 hero maj. gen. @entity50 delivered the principal address . the ceremony gave @entity45 its claim to the first organized , community - wide @entity1 observance . watch the meaning of the holiday @entity58 , @entity59 , began holding an annual community service on may 5 , 1866 . although many towns claimed the title , it was @entity58 that won congressional recognition as the " birthplace of @entity1 . " 2 . general @entity50 made it official gen. @entity50 , the speaker at the @entity45 gathering , also was commander of the @entity69 , an organization of @entity38 veterans . on may 5 , 1868 , he issued @entity71 , which set aside may 30 , 1868 , " for the purpose of strewing with flowers , or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion ... . " watch the history of the holiday » the orders expressed hope that the observance would be " kept up from year to year while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades . " watch military kids learn to grieve » 3 . it was first known as @entity1 from the practice of decorating graves with flowers , wreaths and flags , the holiday was long known as @entity1 . the name @entity1 goes back to 1882 , but the older name did n't disappear until after @entity98 federal law declared " @entity1 " the official name in 1967 . 4 . the holiday is a franchise calling @entity1 a " national holiday " is a bit of a misnomer . while there are 11 " federal holidays " created by @entity108 -- including @entity1 -- they apply only to federal employees and the @entity110 . @entity115 , established in 1888 , allowed @entity11 veterans , many of whom were drawing a government paycheck , to honor their fallen comrades with out being docked a day 's pay . for the rest of us , our holidays were enacted state by state . @entity123 was the first state to designate @entity1 a legal holiday , in 1873 . most @entity126 states had followed suit by the 1890s . the states of the @entity130 were unenthusiastic about a holiday memorializing those who , in gen. @entity50 's words , " united to suppress the late rebellion . " the @entity130 did n't adopt the may 30 @entity1 until after @entity135 , by which time its purpose had been broadened to include those who died in all the country 's wars . in 1971 , the @entity140 shifted @entity1 from may 30 , to the last monday of the month . @entity0 : 10 holidays not yet exploited by @entity142 5 . it was @entity145 's finest hour -- or maybe hour - and - a - half on may 30 , 1868 , president @entity146 presided over the first @entity1 ceremony at @entity9 -- which , until 1864 , was @entity40 gen. @entity149 's plantation . some 5,000 people attended on a spring day which , the @entity152 reported , was " somewhat too warm for comfort . " the principal speaker was @entity145 , a @entity11 general , @entity155 congressman from @entity157 and future president . " i am oppressed with a sense of the impropriety of uttering words on this occasion , " @entity145 began , and then continued to utter them . " if silence is ever golden , it must be beside the graves of fifteen - thousand men , whose lives were more significant than speech , and whose death was a poem the music of which can never be sung . " it went on like that for pages and pages . as the songs , speeches and sermons ended , the participants helped to decorate the graves of the @entity38 and @entity40 soldiers buried in the cemetery . 6 . not even the unknown soldier can avoid media scrutiny these days " here rests in honored glory an @entity189 soldier known but to @entity190 . " that is the inscription on the @entity192 , established at @entity9 to inter the remains of the first unknown soldier , a @entity135 fighter , on november 11 , 1921 . unknown soldiers from @entity98 and the @entity197 subsequently were interred in the tomb on @entity1 1958 . an emotional president @entity199 presided over the interment of six bones , the remains of an unidentified @entity204 soldier , on november 28 , 1984 . fourteen years later , those remains were disinterred , no longer unknown . spurred by an investigation by @entity208 , the defense department removed the remains from the @entity192 for dna testing . the once - unknown fighter was @entity213 pilot lt. @entity212 , whose jet crashed in @entity215 in 1972 . " the @entity208 investigation suggested that the military review board that had changed the designation on lt. @entity212 's remains to ' unknown ' did so under pressure from veterans ' groups to honor a casualty from the @entity204 , " the @entity152 reported in 1998 . lt. @entity212 was reburied near his hometown of @entity226 , @entity227 . his crypt at @entity9 remains permanently empty . watch digital memorial to troops of @entity231 and @entity232 » 7 . @entity215 vets go whole hog on @entity1 weekend in 1988 , 2,500 motorcyclists rode into @entity110 , for the first @entity237 rally to draw attention to @entity204 soldiers still missing in action or prisoners of war . by 2002 , the numbers had swelled to 300,000 bikers , many of them veterans . there may have been a half - million participants in 2005 in what organizers bluntly call " a demonstration -- not a parade . " a national veterans rights group , @entity237 takes its name from the @entity253 carpet - bombing runs during the war in @entity215 . @entity255 ( and you thought only @entity258 and @entity259 movies used roman numerals ) is sunday , may 24 . 8 . @entity1 has its customs general orders no. 11 stated that " in this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed , " but over time several customs and symbols became associated with the holiday . it is customary on @entity1 to fly the flag at half staff until noon , and then raise it to the top of the staff until sunset . taps , the 24 - note bugle call , is played at all military funerals and memorial services . it originated in 1862 when @entity38 gen. @entity283 " grew tired of the ' lights out ' call sounded at the end of each day , " according to the @entity284 . together with the brigade bugler , @entity283 made some changes to the tune . not long after , the melody was used at a burial for the first time , when a battery commander ordered it played in lieu of the customary three rifle volleys over the grave . the battery was so close to enemy lines , the commander was worried the shots would spark renewed fighting . the @entity135 poem " in @entity303 , " by @entity302 , inspired the @entity1 custom of wearing red artificial poppies . in 1915 , a @entity307 teacher and volunteer war worker named @entity309 began a campaign to make the poppy a symbol of tribute to veterans and for " keeping the faith with all who died . " the sale of poppies has supported the work of the @entity319 . 9 . there is still a grey @entity1 several @entity130 states continue to set aside a day for honoring the @entity40 dead , which is usually called @entity322 : @entity323 : fourth monday in april ; @entity307 : april 26 ; @entity324 : june 3 ; @entity33 : last monday in april ; @entity325 : may 10 ; @entity326 : may 10 ; @entity327 ( @entity322 ) : june 3 ; @entity328 ( @entity322 ) : january 19 ; @entity329 : last monday in may . @entity0 : the @entity331 's plan to conquer @entity332 10 . each @entity1 is a little different no question that @entity1 is a solemn event . still , do n't feel too guilty about doing something frivolous , like having barbecue , over the weekend . after all , you were n't the one who instituted the @entity338 on may 30 , 1911 . that credit goes to @entity341 businessman @entity340 . the winning driver that day was @entity343 , who averaged 74.6 mph and completed the race in 6 hours and 42 minutes . @entity345 returned on may 30 , 1922 , when the @entity346 was dedicated . @entity348 chief justice ( and former president ) @entity347 dedicated the monument before a crowd of 50,000 people , segregated by race , and which included a row of @entity38 and @entity40 veterans . also attending was @entity357 's surviving son , @entity356 . and in 2000 , @entity108 established a @entity358 , which asks @entity189 to pause for one minute at 3 p.m. in an act of national unity . the time was chosen because 3 p.m. " is the time when most @entity189 are enjoying their freedoms on the national holiday .
