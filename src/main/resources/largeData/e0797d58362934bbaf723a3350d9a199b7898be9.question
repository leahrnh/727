" in particular what warnings did he receive beforehand , and how rigorous was the vetting and interview process ? " regardless of the verdicts , this trial has raised important questions about the relationship between the political , economic and media elites in the @entity8 .

" @entity60 , the @entity8 newspaper publishing arm of @entity12 's @entity145 , said in a statement : " we said long ago , and repeat today , that wrongdoing occurred , and we apologized for it . we have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations . " the publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new @entity8 press watchdog expected to start work later this year .

" she denied there had been a long - standing affair but acknowledged there had been periods of physical intimacy . the @entity202 and @entity203 newspaper reported that when @entity1 testified in april -- with his wife watching from the public gallery -- he said the affair " should n't have happened . " but he denied that it meant he and @entity20 had shared sensitive stories , the outlets said . in her defense , @entity20 denied in court that she had ever approved phone hacking while she was @entity34 editor . asked about the practice , @entity20 said : " no desk editor , no journalist ever came to me and said , ' we 're working on such and such story , and we need to access their voice mails .
