@entity0 -- @entity1 hated the young man as soon as he saw him . @entity1 at a @entity4 coal mine prison camp in 1944 . the man 's almond - shaped eyes , dark hair and olive skin -- @entity1 had seen those @entity10 facial features before . he saw that face when he watched @entity4 soldiers behead sick men begging for water , run over stumbling prisoners with tanks and split his comrades ' skulls with rifle butts . " men died like flies , " @entity1 says . " i thought for a while i would never make it . " @entity1 , now 91 , is one of the last survivors of the @entity25 . during @entity27 , the @entity4 army forced @entity29 and @entity30 prisoners of war on a march so horrific that the @entity4 commander was later executed for war crimes . @entity1 returned home to @entity36 after the war to teach , but he still had something to learn . when he saw a young @entity4 - @entity29 student seated in his class one day , he felt both anger and anguish . what , he wondered , do i do with all of the hate i 've brought home with me ? ' the worst war story ' he ever heard @entity1 's answer to that question can be found in the new book " @entity51 , " a searing depiction of the @entity25 . the book details how @entity1 found help through an unlikely source . but he would first have to survive one of the worst defeats in @entity29 military history . in december 1941 , @entity4 forces attacked an army of @entity29 and @entity30 soldiers in the @entity30 and forced them to surrender . they captured 76,000 prisoners , double what they had expected . the @entity4 forced the @entity64 to march 66 miles under a tropical sun to a railway station for transport . they shot , bayoneted and beat to death prisoners who could n't keep pace . at least 7,000 soldiers died during the march . more died later . the brutal conditions of the march contributed to the subsequent deaths of an estimated 25,000 @entity30 and 1500 @entity29 in @entity4 prison camps , says @entity75 , a @entity76 veteran who wrote " @entity77 , " with his wife , @entity78 . " it 's the worst war story i 've ever heard , " @entity75 says . " what they [ the @entity4 ] did was monstrous . " prisoners were forced to bury others alive and work as slave laborers ; some were executed for sport . one @entity4 soldier , who later became a @entity89 priest , told the authors that he is still haunted by what he did on @entity93 . some @entity30 who live today near the march 's route say that they , too , can not forget what happened , @entity94 says . " they would tell us that when they lay awake at night , they thought they could still hear the trampling of the men 's feet on the death march , " she says . why @entity1 survived the death march was filled with villains , but the authors also found a hero : @entity1 . the march is told through his eyes and drawings . @entity1 was a cowboy from @entity36 who could ride a horse , rope cattle and shoot by the time he was 8 years old . " i thought that if anybody gets out of here , i 'm going to be one of them , " says @entity1 , who was a 22 - year - old @entity113 private when he was captured . at times , though , @entity1 wondered whether he was being too optimistic . he was bayoneted , starved and beaten . he was constantly ill , and his weight fell to 112 pounds . @entity1 found a way to preserve his mind even as his body wasted away : he drew . he started sketching pictures of what he saw during his captivity . " i felt an obligation to show people what went on there , " he says . @entity1 was released after three years of captivity when @entity27 ended . he returned to @entity131 , @entity36 , where he became an art professor at a state college . " i had a lot of anger when i got home , " @entity1 says . " we were beaten for so long . i hated [ the @entity4 ] . " @entity1 meets his ' nemesis ' @entity1 's hatred smoldered for 15 years . it threatened to spill out into the open in 1960 , when he walked into his classroom on the first day of the semester and saw a @entity4 - @entity29 student . in " @entity77 , " @entity1 says that his " heart hardened and filled with hate . " but he was so anguished by what he was feeling , he returned to his office after class to think . he told himself that the war was over ; he was n't a prisoner anymore , and he had to treat the @entity4 - @entity29 student like anybody else , because he was an @entity29 , too . then he did something else . he invited the student to his office for a talk . the student 's name was @entity157 , and he , too , had been marked by the war . his family had been imprisoned at a " relocation camp " in @entity161 during the war . @entity1 also discovered that he and @entity157 had something else in common : a passion for drawing @entity36 's rural life . by the end of the semester , @entity157 was one of @entity1 's best students . @entity1 says that talking to @entity157 helped his hatred evaporate . " we had a discussion and finally came to an understanding that we liked each other , " he says . today , @entity1 and @entity157 remain in touch . " we 're the best of friends , " @entity157 tells @entity0 from his @entity36 art studio . " we see each other regularly . " @entity157 says he ca n't remember exactly what he and @entity178 talked about first , only that @entity1 had always treated him well . @entity1 did tell him later that their relationship helped him recover from the war , he says . " i was just there , " @entity157 says . " i just happened to be there for him to use my presence as a way to overcome his dark time . " @entity157 says he is still amazed by @entity1 's survival story . " just to be a part of his life is an honor , " @entity157 says . @entity1 's voice is still strong and his mind sharp . he 's been married to his wife , @entity194 , for 57 years , and they have three children and six grandchildren . @entity1 says @entity93 taught him to treasure small pleasures , like a drink of cool water and a warm bed at night . " i 'm thankful that i have a plateful of food , " he says . " i can remember when that plate was empty . " he still remembers tiny details from the death march as well . he constantly draws pictures of his friends and tormentors on @entity93 . their faces fill his sketchbooks . @entity1 's hate may be gone , but the death march lingers . " i think about it every day , " he says . " it 's in my mind , and i 'll never get it out . "
