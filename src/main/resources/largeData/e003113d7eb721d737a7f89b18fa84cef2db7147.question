@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- sen. @entity2 backed sen. @entity3 for president monday , saying , " it is time again for a new generation of leadership . " sens. @entity2 and @entity3 are all smiles after @entity2 endorsed @entity3 . " it is time now for @entity3 , " the @entity11 senator and brother of the late president @entity2 added . he stood with @entity3 , his son , rep. @entity14 , and his niece , @entity16 , before a screaming capacity crowd of students at @entity19 in @entity0 . " like you , we want a president who appeals to the hopes of those who still believe in the @entity25 , " he said . " i 've found that candidate . and it looks to me like you have too , " he said . watch @entity2 compare @entity3 to @entity29 » after @entity2 spoke , @entity3 told the boisterous crowd : " i know what your support means . i know the cherished place the @entity2 family holds in the hearts of the @entity37 people . " the @entity39 @entity38 said he would work to carry on the vision the senator 's brother laid out when he was president nearly five decades ago . " the dream has never died ... it lives on in those @entity44 , young and old , rich and poor , black and white , @entity45 and @entity46 and @entity47 , gay and straight , who are tired of a politics that divides us and want to recapture the sense of common purpose that we had when @entity29 was president of the @entity44 , " @entity3 said . " that is the dream we hold in our hearts , " @entity3 said . " that is the kind of leadership we long for in this country . and that is the kind of leadership i intend to offer as @entity62 . " @entity2 said he has always planned to " support the candidate who inspires me , who inspires all of us , who can lift our vision and summon our hopes and renew our belief that our country 's best days are still to come . " watch @entity3 explain why @entity2 decided to endorse him » picking up on @entity3 's central campaign theme , he said , " i feel change in the air . what about you ? " @entity2 praised sen. @entity75 and former sen. @entity76 , saying @entity76 " has been a powerful advocate for economic and social justice . and @entity75 has been in the forefront on issues ranging from health care to the rights of women around the world . " whoever is our nominee will have my enthusiastic support , " he said . but he also took a line from @entity91 's campaign , saying @entity3 " is ready to be president on day 1 . " in what may have been a veiled swipe at @entity91 , @entity2 said of @entity3 , " from the beginning , he opposed the war in @entity98 . and let no one deny that truth . " @entity91 has pointed to various statements @entity3 has made about @entity98 , suggesting he has not been consistent -- an accusation he has denied . @entity2 -- a fixture of the @entity104 popular with many liberals -- was introduced by @entity16 , who spoke of her father , the slain president . she said @entity3 offers the " sense of hope and inspiration " that @entity44 today need . in fact , she said , her children " were the first people who made me realize that @entity3 is the president we need . " the @entity114 reported monday that sen. @entity2 endorsed @entity3 despite pleas from the @entity91 camp to remain neutral in the @entity104 race . the @entity11 senator decided to endorse @entity3 after becoming concerned about the often - bitter campaigning involving former president clinton before saturday 's @entity124 primary , which @entity3 won , the newspaper reported . the @entity114 said @entity2 was angry the former president had introduced what he felt were racial themes into the campaign and that @entity91 had made misleading statements about @entity3 , matters @entity2 and @entity91 discussed during two heated telephone conversations earlier this month . @entity16 endorsed @entity3 in a weekend @entity114 editorial . members of the @entity2 clan are split in the race . former @entity136 lt. gov. @entity135 issued a statement sunday stating her support for @entity91 . " i respect @entity16 and @entity2 's decision , but i have made a different choice , " she said . " while i admire sen. @entity3 greatly , i have known @entity75 for over 25 years and have seen firsthand how she gets results . as a woman , leader and person of deep convictions , i believe @entity75 would make the best possible choice for president . " she added that her brother @entity149 and sister @entity150 are also backing @entity91 . @entity135 is the oldest child of @entity151 . sen. @entity2 's decision to endorse @entity3 could help @entity3 's campaign as he seeks momentum toward @entity156 on february 5 , when 22 states and @entity158 will weigh in on the @entity104 race . in polls , @entity3 has trailed @entity91 nationally . @entity3 , coming off the @entity124 victory , has been seeking to expand his support nationwide . he won that state with the help of a large majority of @entity37 voters , while most white voters supported @entity91 or @entity76 . sen. @entity2 spoke enthusiastically , interrupted by frequent applause from the young crowd . " when @entity29 thought of going to the moon , he did n't say no , it was too far , maybe we could n't get there and should n't even try , " he said . " i am convinced we can reach our goals only if we are not petty when our cause is so great -- only if we find a way past the stale ideas and stalemate of our times -- only if we replace the politics of fear with the politics of hope -- and only if we have the courage to choose change . " @entity3 is the one person running for president who can bring us that change . @entity3 is the one person running for president who can be that change . " e-mail to a friend @entity1 's @entity190 contributed to this report .
