when the cheers subside in @entity2 , @entity0 will assume an @entity4 presidency straightjacketed by the country 's military , start work under intense international scrutiny and inherit a country on its back economically . he 'll face the skepticism of people like @entity13 , one of the throng that waited for sunday 's declaration of @entity0 's victory in @entity2 . even as he cheered the result , @entity13 said the real power in @entity4 still lies with the @entity19 , which took power after the ouster of longtime strongman @entity22 . " they do n't give us power . @entity0 is just a name of president , " @entity13 said . " he does n't have the power , @entity19 has the power . " @entity4 's electoral commission declared @entity0 the country 's president - elect sunday after a runoff with @entity31 , a former air force general who served as @entity22 's last prime minister . with the announcement of @entity0 's victory , cheers erupted in @entity2 , the @entity36 plaza that was the center of the 2011 revolt that toppled @entity22 . @entity0 urges unity in first speech his supporters already are pushing for a confrontation with the generals , who recently ordered an elected , @entity45 - dominated parliament dissolved and announced they would retain legislative power for an indefinite time . " will the military council respect the @entity4 will or not ? " asked @entity48 , a member of parliament from @entity0 's @entity49 , the political arm of @entity4 's long - suppressed @entity51 . " if it respects it , we will be able to work together . if it does not , the military council knows very well where @entity22 is right now . " @entity48 said the @entity51 and its supporters would remain in @entity2 until they get what they want . @entity60 , a historian at the @entity61 , said that determination is born of the hard lessons that followed the ouster of @entity22 , who has been sentenced to life in prison for ordering the killings of anti-government protesters in the 2011 revolt . world leaders , regular folks react to @entity0 's victory " we thought the revolution was over , that we won when we forced the president to resign , and we went back home , " @entity60 told @entity74 . " and obviously , the revolution was far from being over , and our demands were far from being answered . " @entity19 dissolved parliament elected earlier this year following a ruling by @entity4 's high court that the law governing the parliamentary elections was invalid . the generals said the new president would set a date for parliamentary elections and would have the power to appoint government officials , name ambassadors to foreign countries and grant pardons -- but the junta will keep legislative power and the budget in its hands until new lawmakers are elected . the @entity51 and the secular liberal groups that launched the 2011 protests have to maintain that presence to keep pressure on the government , @entity60 said . meanwhile , he said , the military 's announcement that it would retain legislative and budgetary power " is effectively a recipe for at best a paralysis in the executive branch of the government . " the @entity51 explained at worst , it could mean a fight with the generals at a time when @entity4 's economy is still recovering from the nosedive that accompanied the revolution . " they 've lost 2 million jobs since february of last year , " said @entity116 congressman @entity115 , an election observer during the runoff . " by virtue of that , they really need to get the economy growing and get people back to work . " @entity115 , a @entity127 @entity126 , told @entity74 's " @entity132 " that he is backing a @entity116 - @entity4 free trade bill in @entity129 in hopes of boosting @entity4 fortunes . before the revolution , about 40 % of @entity4 lived in poverty . tourism was the bedrock of the country 's economy , " and it has come to standstill " amid the past year 's turmoil , " @entity60 said . " the unemployment rate has hiked up . there 's not much inflation , but occasionally shortages in fuel and shortages of basic supplies , " he said . who is @entity0 ? @entity0 vowed to revive the economy in the speech he delivered to the nation late sunday , telling @entity4 their resources were plentiful but had been " squandered and mismanaged . " and @entity36 's stock market jumped more than 3 % on sunday , which @entity60 called " an indication of how sensitive the markets are for stability . " " in a sense , it 's a vote for the fact that it 's democracy that brings stability rather than the military or the police , " he said . " it 's not a flight of capital out of @entity4 because of @entity45 winning , it 's the exact opposite . it 's a vote of confidence not so much in the @entity51 itself , but in the democratic process . " @entity4 has long been the leading @entity116 ally in the @entity173 world , receiving $ 1.3 billion annually in @entity116 military aid for decades . its peace treaty with @entity176 is a cornerstone of regional diplomacy . @entity176 has reacted cautiously to the elections , issuing a statement sunday that it " appreciates the democratic process in @entity4 and respects the results of the presidential elections . " " @entity176 looks forward to continuing cooperation with the @entity4 government on the basis of the peace treaty between the two countries , which is a joint interest of both peoples and contributes to regional stability , " the statement said . despite his previous fierce criticism of @entity176 -- including calling @entity176 leaders " vampires " and " killers " -- @entity0 pledged sunday night that @entity4 " will preserve all national and international agreements " under his leadership . @entity199 , a former @entity116 ambassador to @entity4 , told @entity74 that abandoning the treaty was " not going to be possible . " " you ca n't just tear up the peace treaty and start over again , " he said . and @entity60 said the hard realities of the economy and the still - unsettled revolution are likely to make revisiting the @entity4 - @entity176 pact a distant prospect . " i do n't think foreign relations , or specifically relations with @entity176 , will be on the top of their priority list , " he said . " they are way too smart to open up this question now , and i do n't think they 're too keen on opening it on the medium front . " why @entity22 's death would n't change @entity4 's future @entity0 also may have to deal with a split in the ranks of his own party , between those who may advocate smoothing things over with the generals and others who want to cultivate ties with secular liberals and leftists . " @entity229 is a huge organization . it is a very venerable organization . it is an old one , " @entity60 said . " but i think it is also facing its greatest threat , and it 's a threat paradoxically prompted by its victory . " the group survived years of crackdowns by @entity4 rulers by staying underground , insisting on cohesion and secrecy and not tolerating dissent . but now , " we 're seeing youthful brothers who , in my reading , have much more in common with the secularist revolutionaries than with the elderly @entity51 members . " nevertheless , the arrival of a democratically elected leader is a moment @entity4 have awaited " for the past 7,000 years , " @entity48 said . " this is a great moment in history , and we 're going to be making history from now on , " he said .

nevertheless , " this is a great moment in history , " says a @placeholder - allied lawmaker
