( @entity0 ) -- comedian / actor @entity1 has departed " @entity5 " after eight seasons , but it 's not like he 's strapped for work . this friday , @entity1 will be seen prominently in the raunchy summer comedy " the @entity7 " opposite @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 . the film comes from @entity1 's wife , writer / director @entity13 , so he 's particularly close to this project . later this summer , he 'll reprise his role as the voice of @entity18 in " @entity19 . " @entity0 spoke with @entity1 about his @entity21 nomination , why he 's moving back to @entity22 and his take on humor 's long shelf life . @entity0 : " the @entity7 " is set in the early ' 90s , an era that a lot of people these days feel nostalgic about . what 's funny to you about this time period ? @entity1 : i do n't really know what 's funny about it . everything is so tech now ; everyone is so connected that way . it 's interesting in this movie that i have to tell @entity8 's character something , and i have to go to her house . which you would never do now . the whole movie would be done in two seconds now . it was the last time when things were in that ' 50s vein . now , if i leave my cell phone at the house , i assume my house is on fire . @entity0 : you play a slacker pool manager , but you yourself are not a slacker . did you ever go through a stoner phase ? @entity1 : no , i never did . i actually do n't smoke pot that much . i 've never been a big pot smoker . and when i do smoke pot , friends always say , " i feel like i 'm smoking pot with my dad . " i was always the designated driver ; i never drank that much . not out of some moral thing . it 's that i was n't that interested in that . i was more of the drinking coffee at the coffee shop crowd . oddly enough , i was n't a very good student . i did n't apply myself that well . i was n't good at doing things i was n't interested in . i used to think i was just slow , and a nice teacher said , " oh , you 're actually really smart , you do n't give a s * * * about anything . " @entity0 : along with playing the lead , you 're also billed as a producer . are you looking to do more behind - the - scenes work in the future , like , say , @entity81 does ? @entity1 : yeah . i 'd love to direct a movie . that 's initially what i wanted to do . acting was never something on my radar . i just did it as a fun extension of wanting to direct . i thought i should act to know what actors go through . i realized the acting thing really took . ( @entity93 . ) @entity0 : last week , the @entity21 nominations came out , and it was the first time a male " @entity5 " cast member has been nominated twice for " @entity97 . " have you been in a " comedy sweet spot " the last few years , the way a basketball player might get hot shooting three pointers ? @entity1 : i do n't know if it 's that or ... i do n't know . i try not to think about it too much , or i 'll go crazy . i used to always think that there was a shelf life on being funny . but i work with ( " @entity109 " creators ) @entity110 ( @entity111 ) and @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , and their show is in its 16th season , and every season is funnier . they figure out new things to do . @entity121 , when he comes by ( " @entity5 " ) , he 's still the funniest human being on the planet . @entity124 still makes me laugh . all these people i liked growing up are still making me laugh . i try not to think about it too much in terms of myself . @entity0 : that 's probably good . you need to get some sleep . @entity1 : it 's not very healthy to think about yourself on those terms . you 'll go nuts . oddly enough , i have really bad stage fright -- getting up in front of people . and i made a living going on live television . @entity0 : would you be paranoid about the reactions after , or was it more of a " once it 's done , it 's done " ? @entity1 : i 'd be done with it . i 've done sketches on the show -- i do n't think i 've ever finished anything and thought , " oh , that was great . " i 'm always like " uhhhh ... why did n't i do this ? " it 's like a trap that i try to wiggle out of on - air . a mental trap . i prepare stuff so compulsively . i 'm constantly rereading . i 'm constantly rereading the sketch , going over it . so i know it so well , and if the slightest thing does n't get a laugh , it used to throw me . toward my last couple seasons on the show , i 'd purposely do something i 've never done before . not so much say things but give a different look or pause differently . something that my brain would say " oh , you screwed up , " and suddenly i would relax . every saturday morning , i 'd wake up , and i 'd immediately start pacing . i could not make my body stop moving . i thought if i stopped moving , it would sink in that i have to go on live television tonight . @entity0 : it seems like leaving " @entity5 " might be good for your health . @entity1 : yeah , good for my mental health . no , i say all this , but in the moment , when it 's happening , it 's actually fun . especially if people are laughing . @entity0 : what was the conversation with @entity177 like ? how does someone resign from this iconic show ? @entity1 : i went into his office in february , and i think he knew that i was going to move to @entity22 . that 's what it was really about . we got a family , and i want a backyard . that 's how it started . it was really just excruciating small talk and then getting into the issue of the leaving . generally , @entity177 said , " i totally get it , you have a family . i would love it if you stayed , but i get it . " around may , i said i wanted to announce it , and that 's how it went . it definitely was hard . people will say that they cried . i thought i was going to pass out . when it was addressed and happened , it felt like a weight had been put on my shoulder or a weight had been lifted . all i know is that the room started tilting a bit . it was a physical reaction to saying the words " i 'm leaving . " it was crazy . i did n't have a career . i worked as an editor on " iron chef : @entity215 " before " snl . " it 's the reason people know me . @entity0 : that 's quite a jump , from " iron chef : @entity215 " to " snl . " @entity1 : it was scary . for four years , i was waiting for them to figure out they made a giant mistake . i still ca n't really believe it . @entity0 : @entity225 has certainly entered the hall of fame of " @entity5 " characters . was he your favorite ? @entity1 : he was one of my favorites . @entity231 , the reporter who was a real * * * * head , i loved playing him . what i liked about doing @entity225 is that you could play it kind of subtle . it was right at the camera .

@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @placeholder "
