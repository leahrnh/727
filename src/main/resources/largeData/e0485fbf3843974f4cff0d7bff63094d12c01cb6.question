@entity0 won saturday 's @entity2 presidential primary , marking a stunning turnaround for a candidate who finished fourth in @entity5 and @entity6 and whose campaign had been left for dead -- again -- by observers just weeks ago . with about 95 % of polling places reporting , @entity9 had 40 % of the vote , with former @entity13 gov. @entity12 getting 27 % and former @entity15 sen. @entity14 getting 17 % . @entity15 rep. @entity16 of @entity17 had 13 % . based on early returns and exit polls , @entity18 projected @entity9 the winner . in his victory speech to supporters , @entity9 thanked " everyone in @entity26 who decided to be with us in changing @entity28 . " " it is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track -- so many people who are so concerned about jobs , about medical costs , about the everyday parts of life , and who feel that the elites in @entity28 and @entity40 have no understanding , no care , no concern , no reliability , and in fact do not represent them at all , " @entity9 said . @entity9 , whose surge has been helped in part by two strong debate performances in @entity26 , said that if he 's resonating with voters , it 's not just because he 's a good debater . up - to - minute updates on @entity18 's live blog " it 's that i articulate the deepest - held values of the @entity15 people , " he said . since the beginning of the modern @entity2 primary system in 1980 , this is the first time that three different @entity2 candidates won nominating contests in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity26 . the winner of the @entity26 primary , which this year is the third contest on the primary and caucus calendar , has gone on to win the @entity70 nomination in every election since 1980 . less than a week ago , @entity12 , the @entity6 winner , was looking at a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in @entity26 , a big lead in @entity76 and the possibility of a clear path to the @entity2 nomination . but @entity9 turned in two strong debate performances in the state this week while @entity12 was put on his heels by his rivals . @entity12 congratulated @entity9 in remarks to his supporters after polls closed saturday night . " this race is getting to be even more interesting , " @entity12 said . " ... we 're now three contests into a long primary season . this is a hard fight because there is so much worth fighting for . " how they voted in @entity26 " our campaign has fought very hard here in @entity26 , and in the coming weeks and months , i 'll keep fighting for every single vote . i will compete in every single state , " he said . " we 're going to win this nomination , and we 're going to defeat president @entity102 in november . " @entity14 , the @entity5 winner , also congratulated @entity9 on saturday night . nearly an hour earlier , he told @entity18 that the battle between the first three contests ' winners is just beginning . " the great narrative is that three days ago , there was an inevitability in this race , " @entity14 said . " @entity12 was 2 - 0 ( before @entity5 officials switched the narrow @entity5 result this week ) and soon to be 3 - 0 , and i took @entity5 , @entity0 took @entity26 , and it 's game on again . " @entity14 said he was preparing not only to campaign in @entity76 , where the next primary awaits on january 31 , but in other states , indicating he believed he had what it took to sustain his campaign for a long fight . " this is a long race . as a result of what happened here tonight , this race is n't going to be over next week or the week after , " @entity14 said . " this is going to be a long one , and it 's going to be the best thing that could happen for whoever the eventual @entity70 nominee is , because that nominee is going to be sharpened by steel . " @entity16 told supporters he expected to get four to five times as many votes in @entity26 as he did four years ago . " so there 's every reason to be encouraged , " he said . @entity9 's @entity26 turnaround is just his latest . he came out of nowhere to top national polls in late fall on the strength of debate performances , but dropped again ahead of the @entity5 caucuses as opponents hammered him in @entity5 ads. " @entity9 has been harder to kill than @entity143 , " @entity70 strategist and @entity18 contributor @entity145 said saturday . " he has been dead three times in this campaign , and ... the guy keeps coming back . " are you voting in the @entity26 primary ? share your story according to exit polls saturday , 38 % of voters said they decided whom to vote for in the " last few days , " and 17 % did so on saturday . of the " last few days " crowd , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 26 % took @entity12 . of those who decided saturday , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 21 % took @entity12 . @entity9 won a plurality of votes among all income categories except the one for people making $ 200,000 a year or more , a category that @entity12 won with 47 % , according to the exit polls . the candidates will now focus on @entity76 , where they will debate in @entity164 on monday and at the @entity18 / @entity70 of @entity76 debate in @entity166 on thursday . the former @entity168 speaker has been presenting himself as the conservative alternative to the " @entity13 moderate " @entity12 , while @entity12 continued to attack @entity9 as he has over the past week as polls tightened . @entity12 supporters and donors were grumbling saturday that @entity12 's campaign badly mishandled how he responded to rivals ' demands that he release his tax records . @entity12 said in a @entity18 debate thursday night that he was not sure how many years of tax returns he plans to release but will make them public sometime in april . but as the polls were closing , a @entity12 source tried to downplay the results , noting that @entity12 got only 15 % of the vote in @entity26 in 2008 , a race that eventual nominee sen. @entity185 won . the campaign will immediately pivot to @entity76 , the source said , where " we have a strong organization and big plans for next week . " @entity12 has held a large lead in polls of likely primary voters there , but recent polls show the race tightening a bit there , too . three @entity70 sources told @entity18 that @entity12 has secured the endorsement of former @entity76 gov. @entity201 , who is on many @entity70 ' wish list . but a @entity201 source denied the report , and sources in @entity12 's campaign said if that is true , he had n't told them . the campaign plans a " major " economic speech on tuesday morning as a prebuttal to @entity102 's @entity211 address that evening and differentiate @entity12 from @entity102 and @entity9 . he also plans a reaction speech to @entity102 's address on wednesday morning . @entity12 launched a new line of attack on @entity9 on saturday before polls closed , calling for him to release details on his work for government - backed mortgage giant @entity219 , an institution unpopular with conservatives . " did n't he say he was going to release information about his relationship there ? " @entity12 asked . " let 's see what report he wrote for @entity227 and @entity219 , what his conclusions were and what the contract looked like . i thought he said he was going to do that . " @entity12 's campaign also has been pressing the former @entity168 speaker to release the full report from a 1990s ethics investigation that led to his downfall in @entity239 . @entity9 was reprimanded by the @entity168 and ordered to pay a $ 300,000 penalty in 1997 for violating an ethics rule . this week , @entity12 's campaign sent @entity9 a cake marking the 15th anniversary of that reprimand , according to a @entity12 campaign source . a picture provided by that source shows the wording " happy 15th anniversary , mr. speaker ! ... now release the records , " written in icing on the cake . things reversed quickly for @entity12 in @entity26 this week . as late as tuesday , @entity12 had a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in the state 's primary . then what had been declared an eight - vote @entity12 victory in @entity5 's january 3 caucuses was reversed into a 34 - vote win for @entity14 when the state party certified its results on thursday . later that day , @entity17 gov. @entity265 suspended his campaign and threw his support to @entity9 . " it has been a hard week , " state treasurer @entity268 , a leading @entity12 surrogate , said friday . " nobody is going to deny that . " @entity14 spent the week trying to bring down @entity9 in what most see as a race between the moderate @entity12 against conservatives @entity9 or @entity14 . although most @entity2 strategists see @entity16 's strict interpretation of the @entity277 and his views on defense and spending as out of step with the mainstream , he appeals to libertarian - leaning @entity70 and has a large following among younger voters .
