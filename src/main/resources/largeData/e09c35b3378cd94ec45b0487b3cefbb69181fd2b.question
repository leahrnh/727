( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's leadership as secretary of state regarding the @entity5 terrorist group @entity4 could become at least as serious an issue as her decisions surrounding the attack on the @entity10 consulate in @entity11 . much of the attention thursday was on the announcement that the @entity14 will create a select committee to investigate @entity11 , but the same day , @entity17 reporter @entity16 revealed details about her time as secretary of state that raise significant questions about her broader record on issues of terrorism . @entity16 reported that from 2011 through early 2013 , the @entity26 @entity25 repeatedly rejected efforts to designate @entity4 as a terrorist organization . in recent weeks , the group has exploded onto the world stage by kidnapping more than 250 girls at a @entity5 boarding school . it is so clearly and vividly a terrorist organization that it seems indefensible that the @entity25 would have refused to designate it as such . a thorough investigation of the decision process that protected @entity4 from 2011 until late 2013 could be devastating . now that @entity4 has attracted worldwide attention for its vicious assault on young girls , political leaders , including the former secretary of state , are rushing to issue emotionally powerful but practically meaningless statements . @entity2 tweeted : " access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls . we must stand up to terrorism . # @entity50 " @entity26 's tweet contrasts vividly with her failure to stand up to terrorism in 2011 by calling @entity4 what it was . the requests to designate @entity4 as a terrorist organization were serious and came from very responsible authorities . as @entity16 reported : " what @entity26 did n't mention was that her own @entity25 refused to place @entity4 on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011 , after the group bombed the @entity66 headquarters in @entity67 . the refusal came despite the urging of the @entity70 , the @entity71 , the @entity72 , and over a dozen @entity73 and @entity74 . " ' the one thing she could have done , the one tool she had at her disposal , she did n't use . and nobody can say she was n't urged to do it . it 's gross hypocrisy , ' said a former senior @entity10 official who was involved in the debate . ' the @entity71 , the @entity72 , and the @entity70 really wanted @entity4 designated , they wanted the authorities that would provide to go after them , and they voiced that repeatedly to elected officials . ' " in may 2012 , then - @entity70 official @entity87 ( now at the @entity14 ) wrote to the @entity25 to urge @entity26 to designate @entity4 as a terrorist organization . the following month , gen. @entity89 , the chief of @entity90 , said that @entity4 provided a ' safe haven ' for @entity92 and was likely sharing explosives and funds with the group . and yet , @entity2 's @entity25 still declined to place @entity4 on its official terrorist roster . " the protection of @entity4 from designation as a terrorist organization is even more unbelievable when you read the description of the group 's activities in the @entity105 's @entity104 of @entity106 . consider the following highlights : -- @entity4 means " @entity109 education is sinful . " -- the initial @entity4 organization grew to an estimated 280,000 followers . in 2009 there was a huge fight with the @entity114 and over 1,000 followers and the founder were killed . -- a revitalized @entity4 launched an attack on @entity119 prison on september 7 , 2010 . -- since then they have carried out over 600 attacks , killing more than 3,800 people . -- @entity4 's orientation can be discerned in its support for @entity127 - like , extremist @entity126 law and its designation of its original encampment in northern @entity5 as " @entity130 . " -- the @entity5 terrorists have allied with @entity92 and a number of transnational terrorist groups . -- on christmas day in 2011 , @entity4 staged church bombings . -- @entity4 has deep ties with extremists in @entity137 . supposedly dozens have been trained in @entity130 . given these facts , it is amazing that @entity26 's @entity25 refused to designate @entity4 as a terrorist organization , since clearly it was engaged in terrorist activities . why would the department she led not call a terrorist group a terrorist group when it was in her power to do so , and , as @entity16 reports , the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity70 , and many members of both the @entity14 and @entity149 were urging her to do just that ? @entity16 reports that some @entity10 officials , and possibly the @entity5 government , opposed the listing because , among other reasons , they thought it might give the group more publicity . but this is a fairly weak rationale . for one thing , @entity4 seems to have managed the publicity part on its own . and despite designating three individuals associated with @entity4 as terrorists in june 2012 , by refusing to list the organization , the @entity25 was denying the @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity70 the tools they were seeking to use against the group as a whole and anyone linked to it . it is a potentially devastating addition to a record as secretary of state that included a number of decisions favoring the @entity175 in @entity176 ( after abandoning a longtime @entity10 ally there ) , as well as appeasing a virulently anti-american regime in @entity179 -- moves that have not turned out so well , to say the least . now the @entity4 decision raises a whole new set of questions . how could the @entity26 @entity25 reject naming @entity4 as a terrorist group ? who was involved in blocking @entity4 's terrorist designation ? are any of the so - called experts who were totally wrong still at the @entity25 ? did @entity26 have anything to do with refusing to designate @entity4 ? if not , was she even aware of the controversy ? should n't she certainly have been aware , considering the number of federal agencies and members of @entity194 that were asking her to designate the organization ? these questions about @entity26 's record are potentially even more serious than the questions about @entity11 . as congressman @entity200 , who chairs the @entity201 on @entity202 , told @entity16 , by failing to designate @entity4 as a terrorist organization in 2011 , " we lost two years of increased scrutiny . the kind of support that is taking place now would have been in place two years ago . " in light of the recent events in @entity5 , former secretary @entity26 and other key @entity25 officials owe the @entity10 people some answers about their decisions .
