( @entity0 ) -- so it 's over , huh ? i 'm sorry . here are some books to feed your heart and keep your brain / hands busy so you do n't pour yourself a big glass of @entity10 and battery acid . 1 . " @entity12 , her , @entity14 , @entity15 " by @entity16 seriously . read this . realizing that the guy you 've wasted time on for years is a vacuous , pretentious douche nugget is actually kind of funny , and @entity21 proves it . a satirist who writes for the @entity24 , she 's confessed that the book -- about an unnamed , neurotic college girl who spends 10 years pining for a pretentious phd student -- is based on her own experience with her own unnamed douche nugget , which is probably why it feels so right . @entity0 2 . " @entity30 " by @entity31 the lovelorn main character routinely screws over the women he 's dating , but you ca n't help but like him a little bit , since he 's one of those inimitable @entity31 protagonists . it 's snappy and fun to read , and the final story will remind you that men need to realize they 're assholes before they become non-assholes , which sometimes takes awhile . 3 . " @entity44 " by @entity45 a departure from @entity45 's normal @entity48 society jam , this sad - as - hell stark and beautiful novella is about a man with a sickly wife living in a small town who falls for her pretty young caretaker . it does not end well . people have worse lives than you . now go change out of those sweatpants , muchacha . @entity0 : 24 things not to say to a girl who 's been cheated on 4 . " @entity64 " by @entity65 i 'll let ms. @entity65 , a comedian and successful podcaster , sell this for you . " as a kid , i took my cues from [ @entity73 ] @entity72 , chasing every would - be @entity74 in my vicinity with porcine voracity and what i thought was feminine charm . remember how content @entity74 was , just strumming his banjo on a tree trunk in the swamp ? that 's the guy i 've chased my whole life , killing myself trying to show him how fabulous i am . @entity74 never appreciated what he had in @entity72 , because she was just one great thing about his awesome life . i wonder how many guys from my generation looked to @entity74 as an example of what the coolest guy in the room looks like . how maybe they think it 's fine to defer the advances of the fabulous women they know will always be there , while they dreamily pursue creative endeavors and dabble with other contenders . " @entity103 , it 's just so good . @entity0 : a @entity104 5 . " @entity105 " by @entity106 yes , that @entity107 . you might feel like it 's confusing that this book is on the list , but not only is it " scandal " - level entertainment ( and real life ! ) , you also look back at the 1998 scandal in a totally different way than you might have . she was 22 and infatuated with a manipulative married man . sure , he also happened to be the most powerful guy in the free world , but the story is more relatable than you might think . i felt stuff . 6 . " @entity127 " by @entity128 not for the faint - hearted . a blue - collar housekeeper in a police station , being questioned about the murder of her longtime employer , an eccentric and wealthy elderly woman -- and that 's just where it starts . the heart of @entity139 ' story is the actions she takes when her drunk , abusive husband rapes their young daughter . it 's a chilling book but showcases the resilience of women , even those trapped in unbearable circumstances , in a really powerful way . @entity0 : what @entity150 7 . " @entity151 " by @entity152 connected tales of a small town and its residents , who are mostly lonely and sexually repressed . not as bleak as " @entity44 , " but similar deal , except the female characters are more human and complex . 8 . " the position " by @entity161 this novel tracks a suburban family , whose mother and father published a " the @entity168 " - style book of sex positions with paintings of themselves as the models , over a period of about 20 years . the book became a cult success , and their children ( two girls and two boys ) grow up in its shadow . it depicts adult relationships in a very realistic but still interesting , way -- and the character of @entity183 , the older girl , is fascinating . @entity0 : 9 things he does n't want you to know 9 . " @entity187 : love , drugs , @entity190 and coming of age in @entity192 " by @entity193 this sprawling reported non-fiction book is so absorbing that you 'll forget about all your problems . @entity198 , a journalist , captures the tiniest aspects of the lives of two teenage @entity202 girls as they grow up in a bad neighborhood , have kids young , and one ends up in prison for working as a mill girl for her flashy heroin - dealing boyfriend . ( at the end of the book , they 're in their late twenties and mid-thirties ; @entity198 spent 10 years basically living with their families . ) but @entity198 does n't condescend to the women , nor does she criticize their choices . she simply observes and reports , and her dedication shows that she truly cares about breaking the cycle of poverty . 10 . " how did you get this number " by @entity224 @entity224 is like your smartest , funniest female friend , who articulates all the delights and inconveniences about being a young , ambitious woman in a big city that you 've always felt but never known how to explain it . the last essay , " off the @entity236 , " is about @entity224 's relationship with a guy who secretly had another long - term girlfriend at the same time . the girlfriend eventually finds @entity224 in the guy 's phone ( under " @entity240 " ) and calls her . it 's really rough , and it articulates the steps of breakups in a way that will confirm you 're not insane for wanting to smack everyone who asks , " how long were you dating ? " @entity0 : why dinner on the first date is the worst what books helped you move on after a break - up ? share your ideas in the comments on @entity256 or on @entity259 's @entity258 page !

unlikely sources like @placeholder to @entity271 can soothe a break - up
