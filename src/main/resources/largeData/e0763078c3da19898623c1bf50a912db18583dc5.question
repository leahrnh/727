( @entity0 ) -- physical attraction may be as old as time , but new studies are beginning to uncover the science behind sex appeal . unexpected factors -- like biochemical odors , face shape and voice pitch -- just might have more to do with your choice of mate than anyone ever expected . biostatistics expert @entity14 explains why actress @entity16 scored very high on facial attractiveness . @entity18 and @entity19 are leading the research on the human scent 's influence on sexual attraction . they 've found that when women are ovulating , they produce copulins , a scent that attracts men . the researchers believe when a man gets a whiff of copulins , his testosterone levels rise . as a result , he secretes androstenone , an odor that repels women who are n't ovulating . " bars and nightclubs across the world are the battlefield for this invisible biochemical war , " @entity38 says . sex therapist dr. @entity44 says attraction has a lot more to do with science and evolution than people might think . " we are innately all puppies in heat , " she says . " we are capable of discerning 10,000 different scents consciously . but then there 's a whole realm of unconscious scents that we 're not even aware that we 're smelling . " @entity0 : get dr. @entity44 's 5 steps to better sex these odors let people know when a woman is fertile and when a man 's testosterone levels are high , @entity44 says . as a result , individuals can tell when someone else is most ripe for reproduction . " it 's all about survival of the species , " she says . one common complaint @entity44 hears among women with relationship problems is that they love their partner , but they 're not in love with him . " there is a difference between love and chemistry , " @entity44 says . " take a really good whiff of him without cologne when he 's relatively clean . if that smell turns you on , that 's a really good cue of chemistry . " @entity0 : can the chemistry come later ? in one recent study , @entity44 says , researchers had women smell men 's t - shirts . the women were most attracted to the shirts of men with a different major histocompatability complex ( @entity98 ) from them . @entity98 is a collection of genes that are related to immune systems . " we unconsciously want to mate with someone who has a different immune system than ours because that helps with the survival of our offspring , " @entity44 says . the t - shirt study also found that women taking hormonal contraception were attracted to men who had similar @entity98 as they did . " if you 're on the pill , your body is being tricked into think you 're pregnant , so you 're not ovulating , " @entity44 says . " the bad news there is that they have looked at these couples who have similar @entity98 , and not only do they have higher levels of infidelity and higher levels of marital discord , but they also have higher infertility issues . " another unexpected factor that has been found to directly affect attraction is voice pitch . @entity127 , @entity128 , a professor at the @entity129 at @entity130 , says that women with higher estrogen levels have higher voices , which makes them more desirable to men . " when females are midcycle , when they 're the most fertile , the most likely to conceive , their voices are rated as being significantly more attractive , " he says . it 's hard to pinpoint what distinguishes a gorgeous face from an average one , but some researchers are getting pretty close . psychologist @entity142 , @entity128 , of the @entity143 in @entity144 says she 's found that women 's faces get more attractive to men when they are ovulating . " we 're not entirely clear why there 's this difference , but we think that the women might look healthier , have a bit of a healthier glow when they are ovulating . " symmetry is another factor that determines a face 's attractiveness . @entity14 , an assistant professor of biostatistics at the @entity160 , says there is a formula for the " perfect " face . she uses 29 different measurements to determine someone 's appeal on a scale of 1 to 10 . to start , @entity168 says the ratio of the length of the face to the width of the face should be 1.6 , also known as the golden ratio . " the face should also be divided into three equal pieces vertically , " she says . " the forehead , then [ the bottom of the forehead to ] the nose and then from the nose to the chin . " who 's face is the most " perfect , " according to @entity168 's measurements ? no big surprise here ! " @entity188 's is the highest that i 've ever used the [ formula ] on , " she says . " he was a 9.3 [ out of 10 ] . " @entity188 's partner , @entity191 , did n't fare too badly either . " @entity191 was a 7.67 , and that 's pretty high , " @entity168 says . " most people rate about 4 to 6 . ... the thing that is probably lowering her score is the thing that she 's most famous for -- her full lips . " @entity168 says that ideally the width of a mouth should be twice the height of the lips . other celebrities @entity168 tested were @entity16 , who scored a 7.36 , and @entity204 , a 6.45 . " there 's never been anyone who was a perfect 10 , " @entity168 says . " if you 're out there , we 're looking for you ! " not everything that goes into finding a partner is biological . researchers have also found that if a woman looks at the face of a man whom she knows nothing about , she will give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 that 's different than if she is shown the same face and a corresponding income . when a man makes a lot of money , a woman will rate him higher on an attractiveness scale than she would that same man with a smaller income . @entity0 : what do women really want ? @entity44 says this is n't a case of women being gold diggers . " it goes back again to evolution . when we were having babies who were very dependent on us , we could n't hunt and take care of ourselves , so we were looking for the man who had the most social status , who was the best hunter , who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies , " she says . " it 's the same thing today . " smell , voice pitch and face symmetry might be unconscious detectors of attractiveness , but if you 're trying to consciously assess the future of a relationship , @entity44 says there 's one surefire way . " you really learn a lot from a kiss . ... sixty - six percent of women say they would dump a guy after a bad first kiss , " she says . " it 's not only because you 're getting that good whiff of him so you 're seeing if you like the way he smells . all your senses are engaged , and you get a sense of his sensuality , his connection , whether he 's a take - charge kind of guy or more of a stepping back kind . " when it comes to relationships , @entity44 says kissing frequency is a direct indicator of happiness . " it turns out that couples who kiss and cuddle regularly are eight times less likely to be stressed and depressed than couples who do n't get that , " she says . " you have to have a minimum of a 10 - second kiss every day .
