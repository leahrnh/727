" racism does n't get resolved when people hush up about it and sweep it under the rug . it only gets resolved when we talk about it in an educated manner ... as long as we continue to do this , maybe 10 , 20 years from now , race wo n't be so much of an issue . we need to talk about it in a positive manner . we can only learn from this .
