@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a suspect in an alleged @entity4 spy ring was arrested tuesday in @entity5 a day after 10 other suspects in the case were arrested in the @entity8 . @entity10 was arrested at @entity11 in @entity5 after an @entity13 " red notice " was served on him for suspected espionage and money laundering , @entity5 police told @entity1 . authorities in @entity0 were being notified so extradition proceedings can begin , police said . @entity18 , 55 , is free after paying 20,000 euros ( about $ 24,000 ) in cash as bail , but he is not allowed to leave the country , police said . @entity18 received money from a @entity4 agent and buried it in a park in northern @entity26 , according to a court document . two other suspects later showed up at the park to dig up the money , the document said . the @entity31 announced monday that 10 people were arrested on charges of being @entity4 agents involved in a long - term mission in the country . five of the arrested suspects appeared in a @entity40 courtroom monday . four of the five , including a longtime @entity8 - based columnist for the spanish - language @entity43 newspaper , were advised of their rights and ordered held due to flight risk , with their next hearing scheduled for july 1 . the other defendant , identified in a court document as @entity52 , was denied bail , and her next hearing was scheduled for july 27 . the @entity55 said in a statement the arrests are " unfounded and have unseemly goals . " " we do not understand the reasons why the @entity8 @entity31 has made a public statement in the spirit of the @entity66 , " said the statement , posted on the ministry 's website . " such incidents have occurred in the past , when our relations were on the rise . in any case it is regrettable that all these things are happening on the background of the ' reset ' in @entity4 - @entity8 relations announced by the @entity8 administration . " asked about the incident tuesday in an appearance with @entity80 foreign minister @entity79 in @entity81 , @entity4 foreign minister @entity76 said , " we still have not received an explanation . ... i am hopeful we will get an explanation . " he said the timing of the announcement was significant but did not elaborate . asked about the matter again following the news conference with @entity79 , @entity76 said , " i have already said everything . " assistant u.s. attorney @entity91 said search warrants in the case were being executed " across the country . " he called the initial criminal complaint " the tip of the iceberg . " " these people are trained together , " @entity91 said of the defendants . " at the core of this is deception . " separate hearings for the other detained suspects were expected later monday in other states . a @entity4 @entity107 spokesman said monday that he was unaware of the reports of the arrests , and said he was seeking more information from @entity4 officials . the suspects were " trained @entity4 intelligence operatives , " a @entity31 spokesman said , and information from court documents alleged they were part of a mission to plant " deep - cover " agents in the @entity8 . the @entity31 said the 10 people arrested and another person not yet in custody were supposed to recruit intelligence agents , but were not directly involved in obtaining @entity8 secrets themselves . all were charged with acting as agents of a foreign government , and nine also were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering . the charges include conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the @entity8 attorney general , a crime that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison , the @entity31 said . conspiracy to commit money laundering has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison . the case resulted from a " multiyear investigation " conducted by the @entity142 , the @entity143 for the @entity144 and the @entity31 's @entity145 , according to a @entity31 statement . the 11 suspects were charged in two separate criminal complaints . last week , president @entity149 and @entity4 president @entity150 spoke of strengthened ties between the former @entity66 foes after their meeting at the @entity154 . however , court documents and @entity31 officials described a @entity4 intelligence operation straight out of a 1950s spy novel . according to the court documents , some of the suspects adopted phony identities , including those of dead @entity8 , and posed as married couples . the suspects engaged in secret communications including exchanges of bags , money drops and use of invisible ink , as well as more modern touches such as private wireless computer networks between specific laptops , the documents said . a decrypted message from @entity179 to two of the suspects said they were sent to the @entity8 for " long - term service , " one of the documents said . " your education , bank accounts , car , house , etc. -- all these serve one goal : fulfill your main mission , i.e , to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in @entity8 and send intels ( intelligence reports ) , " the document said . the @entity4 operation was believed to date back to the 1990s , the court document said . it added that the @entity142 conducted extensive electronic surveillance of the suspects for years , including secretly recording and videotaping them and surreptitiously entering residences to take photographs and copy documents . one of the suspects is @entity208 , a columnist for " @entity43 " for more than 20 years covering politics , immigration and other issues , her lawyer confirmed . @entity208 is married to @entity212 , another of the suspects arrested monday , and the couple resided in @entity215 , a @entity40 suburb . @entity208 , @entity212 , @entity52 and two other suspects -- identified as @entity217 and @entity218 -- appeared in the @entity40 courtroom . the other suspects were identified in court documents as @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 . another suspect , @entity227 , was still being sought . @entity226 and @entity52 allegedly conducted the private wireless computer links to communicate with a @entity4 government official , one court document alleged . in one instance , @entity52 was in a bookshop and the @entity4 government official drove by in a van to make the wireless connection , the document said . another document described alleged efforts to secretly get money to the suspects to fund their clandestine activities , including money drops involving exchanged bags in public places and other subterfuge . in one incident , @entity18 , the suspect still at large , received money from a @entity4 agent and buried it in a park in northern @entity26 , the document said . @entity225 and @entity224 later showed up at the park to dig up the money , the document said . @entity1 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .
