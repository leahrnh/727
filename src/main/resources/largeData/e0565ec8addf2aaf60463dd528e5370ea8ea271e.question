editor 's note : this is the third in a five - part series exploring judge @entity5 's background and life with those who know her , and revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a @entity11 justice if confirmed . @entity5 won the @entity12 , the highest honor given to an undergraduate at @entity15 . @entity16 , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- @entity5 spent her first week at @entity15 obsessing over the sound of a cricket . growing up in @entity23 , her only notion of this insect was @entity24 from " @entity25 . " she tore her dorm room apart looking for the critter every night . finally , her then - boyfriend and future husband visited and explained that the cricket was outside the room , where she had been holed up most of that week in 1972 . " this was all new to me : we did n't have trees brushing up against windows in the @entity39 , " @entity5 recalled in a speech to the @entity34 in 2002 . the freshman who was so taken aback by a cricket 's chirping now has a more public challenge : @entity45 hearings on whether to confirm her as a @entity11 justice , potentially the first @entity48 to hold such a post . at one time , being different may have been difficult -- for it was n't just @entity15 's crickets that startled @entity5 . the academics and the students on the leafy @entity55 campus , with its ivy - covered dormitories and castle - like towers , also made her feel out of place . @entity5 , who was on a full scholarship , started " a little more on the shy side , " said @entity63 , who attended high school and @entity15 with @entity5 . " she did mention that , as a freshman , she felt sometimes intimidated by others and did n't really raise her hand very much , " said @entity63 , now chairman and ceo of @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity17 . watch classmates , professor remember @entity5 » as a first - year student , @entity5 felt what she 's called a " chasm " between herself and her classmates . she really only knew the @entity39 and @entity79 , while her classmates spoke of @entity81 vacations and skiing . she said in 1990 that she felt she was a " product of affirmative action " and questioned whether she would have been accepted into the @entity83 using " traditional numbers " from test scores alone . see how many of the @entity11 justices went to @entity83 schools » she would certainly have looked different to her classmates , with relatively few latinos or minorities at @entity15 during her college years . even being a woman was different for @entity5 's class -- the college had opened its doors to women three years earlier , but male students were still superior in numbers and ( in some cases ) attitudes . @entity102 , who lived down the hall , explained : " i 'd go to class and i would say things , and the professor would say , ' oh , we usually express ourselves in a more gentlemanly fashion here . ' " @entity102 and @entity5 shared " girl talk " but about what they wanted to do with their lives , not about things like fashion , which interested neither . academically , @entity5 also faced a gap . she would later graduate summa cum laude and be awarded the top undergraduate honor , the @entity12 , but she stumbled that first year . @entity119 , who taught @entity5 and was her thesis adviser , said her early writing reflected the fact that her first language is @entity124 . " she could be very assertive and very articulate , but not initially , " said @entity119 , now a professor at @entity125 . " @entity5 was someone who entered @entity15 as a young woman with enormous potential , and one of the things that happened at @entity15 was , she learned how to fulfill that potential , " he said . @entity131 , now dean of the college , agreed with @entity119 , writing in an e-mail that @entity5 came to @entity15 " with high intelligence and great ability , but without a very sophisticated grounding in the study of history . " @entity131 , who taught history , said she worked with @entity140 to develop the student 's skills in the spring of her first year . @entity5 also worked independently , spending one summer reading classics that were new to her , including " @entity144 , " " @entity145 , " and " @entity146 , " to attune herself more to the cadences of @entity148 , she has said . despite the challenges , the young woman encouraged her friend from the @entity39 , @entity152 , who is one year younger , to enroll in the fall of 1973 . " in the end , clearly she was very happy to have gone to @entity15 , " @entity63 said . and by the time @entity63 began his freshman year , @entity5 was showing off a new personality . " she certainly opened up as she got her feet under her , " said @entity158 , who also majored in history and is now a consultant at @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity163 . with @entity166 , who was a year behind her , @entity5 founded the student organization @entity168 and by 1974 she was speaking out for the group in the @entity171 student paper . the group helped to file a complaint with the @entity174 , alleging that @entity15 showed a " lack of commitment " in recruiting @entity176 students and hiring @entity176 faculty and administrators . hey - @entity166 , now executive director of @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity79 , said @entity5 " has the ability also that if she 's feeling insecure about something , she manages it , and does n't project it . " latino affairs seemed to be an outlet for @entity5 socially . hey - @entity166 said she was focused on her studies but went to some parties , especially @entity190 cultural celebrations . otherwise , @entity166 and @entity102 remember , @entity5 spent time with her off - campus boyfriend , @entity191 . they were later married , but divorced after seven years . outside the university , @entity5 volunteered at the @entity194 as an interpreter . she talked at length with @entity63 , while he was working on a project at the @entity194 police department , about why youth got involved in criminal activities and how the cycle of recidivism might start and stop . " those were issues she was very concerned about , and i think in whatever circles she could , made those feelings known and expressed them , " @entity63 said . see photos from @entity5 's life » @entity5 's interest in @entity190 matters fed her as a history major . she wrote her undergraduate thesis on @entity212 , the first governor of the island elected by popular vote . " she was bending over backwards to be fair to points of view she did n't necessarily agree with , " @entity119 said . the @entity5 who went on to @entity217 had matured , with classmates describing her as " always willing to raise her hand , " " confident , " " outgoing , " and " one of the more outspoken people . " read more about her time at @entity217 she may still have been the girl from the @entity39 , but she did not try to use her experience of hardship as leverage , said @entity226 , a @entity217 classmate of @entity5 and now a professor there . " she would never sit around and say , ' oh , well , i grew up in a housing project so i know , ' " @entity226 said . " she did n't feel her background gave her some kind of special trump . she wanted the argument to work . she would tell you why she thought something , and the ' why ' never had anything to do with where she came from . "

she read children 's classics to enhance her @placeholder writing skills
