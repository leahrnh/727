@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- imagine if @entity1 held a caucus and nobody but @entity5 showed up . @entity6 of all stripes , including @entity9 allies , have predicted for months that the former secretary of state -- who was campaigning for midterm candidates in @entity1 on wednesday -- will face some kind challenge in the race for the @entity6 nomination if she decides to run . the prospect of a @entity9 campaign seems more likely with each passing day . but with the presidential race set to lurch into gear after next week 's midterm elections and no clear alternative to @entity9 emerging , there are questions about whether she will be the sole candidate on the ballot . that would mark a dramatic shift from the rollicking caucus fights in previous campaigns , including @entity9 's battle with @entity30 and @entity31 in 2008 . " there is a distinct possibility that there will be no serious alternative , " said @entity32 , a plugged - in @entity6 activist from @entity33 , @entity1 . " she may in essence have the field to herself , with one or two fringe protest candidates and no serious candidates opposing her . " the prospect of an uncontested race is a little bewildering to some @entity6 here , where competitive caucuses are ingrained in the culture . " it could be a process with just one person , " said @entity50 , a longtime @entity9 loyalist in @entity0 . " none of us can imagine that , because it has n't really happened before . " for their part , the @entity57 is n't worrying about a boring race . a platoon of @entity57 — @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and others — have paraded through @entity1 for the last two years , almost shamelessly transparent about their national intentions . among the cast of @entity6 potentials , @entity68 gov. @entity67 is the most active in @entity1 , helping candidates up and down the ballot with campaign stops , paid staffers and financial assistance . @entity77 sen. @entity76 is also visible . both men have said they are seriously considering running regardless of what @entity9 does , though it 's hard to imagine @entity76 , a 73 - year - old self - described socialist , mounting much more than a protest candidacy . meanwhile , @entity84 sen. @entity83 , a progressive darling with grassroots appeal , whipped up a frenzy in the college town of @entity89 earlier this month at a campaign event for @entity92 candidate @entity91 in @entity89 . former @entity94 sen. @entity93 is weighing a run and @entity84 gov. @entity96 has n't quite ruled it out . vice president @entity98 , of course , is nurturing his long - standing relationships in the state . and @entity102 sen. @entity101 was warmly received after a headline speech at the state @entity6 's @entity104 last weekend . but she also typified the reluctance of @entity6 to step forward until @entity9 's decision is clear . " i am excited about the possibility of @entity5 running , " @entity101 said in an interview . " democratic women senators have signed onto a letter asking her to run . i am one of them . i have put that in writing . " all of the @entity6 , with the possible exception of @entity98 , are not widely - known to most voters and have room to grow their support in @entity1 if they run . the state has rewarded insurgent candidacies in the past , and @entity9 is a well - defined politician whose centrist politics and cautious instincts could make leave vulnerable to a challenge from a fresher - faced candidate with stronger progressive impulses . " for @entity5 , it 's about meeting the expectations , because she ca n't exceed them , " said state rep. @entity128 , who is the @entity6 nominee in @entity1 's @entity129 . " the thing about @entity1 is they will give everybody a look , so you ca n't rule anybody out at this point . " but it 's also real possibility that none of the other choices run — they have said as much publicly , with @entity144 particularly forceful in her denials — potentially leaving @entity9 in the driver 's seat with no one riding shotgun . democrats here fear that a non-competitive one - woman show would sap the caucuses of grassroots energy and the potential for party - building , even with the history - making potential of her candidacy . " if you look at the vigor that a caucus or primary brings to a party long - term , you have to hope that happens every once in an awhile , " @entity32 said . " if it had n't happened two cycles in a row , in 2004 and 2008 , then our party would be weaker than it is today . " @entity172 , a political reporter and anchor for @entity174 in @entity0 , said a non-competitive @entity6 caucus would offer @entity57 another presidential cycle in the @entity1 limelight , " bashing @entity6 non-stop . " he said @entity1 's quadrennial caucus - industrial - complex would much prefer a two feisty battles , as it did during the busy winter of 2007 and 2008 , rather than just one . " restaurants , hotels , everyone here gets used to it , " said @entity172 , the author of " @entity181 , " a chronicle of the 2012 @entity1 contest . " it becomes its own spectator sport . you see people going all over town the week before the caucuses trying to see famous people , politicians , journalists , operatives , whoever . " though past campaigns are never predictive , even those preparing for a @entity9 challenge struggle to remember a previous caucus dynamic like this one : a singular , dominant frontrunner — who still needs to make inroads with an electorate that never quite warmed to her in 2008 — and a cast of smaller figures who may or may not run . " i do n't recall anything like this , " said @entity50 , the @entity9 supporter . there was the 1992 caucus campaign , when @entity1 sen. @entity216 , the hometown liberal , sought the @entity6 nomination , allowing his opponents to forfeit the state and focus their energies on @entity221 and elsewhere . another close analogy : the 2000 race , when the frontrunner , vice president @entity224 , fought off a challenge on the left from @entity227 . like @entity9 , @entity224 was the cautious heir apparent . @entity227 had the field to himself , after other potential candidates like @entity230 and @entity231 took a pass . but unlike the democrats who might challenge @entity9 for the 2016 nomination , @entity227 was not gun shy . after aggressively courting @entity1 @entity6 for months , he launched an exploratory committee in december of 1998 , just weeks after the midterm elections , and immediately set about raising money and framing himself as the liberal alternative to @entity224 , focusing on education and poverty . @entity224 , though , ultimately defeated @entity227 in @entity1 , 63 - 35 , on his way to the nomination . to mount anything more than a gadfly candidacy against @entity9 in today 's drawn - out , media - saturated nominating process will require a boatload of cash . @entity9 and @entity30 both raised over $ 100 million before the january 2008 caucuses , and that was almost seven years ago — before the @entity254 ruling made the political system even more awash in money . looking at the field of potential @entity9 rivals , only @entity144 seems to have a natural base , the potential to raise serious money and a significant grassroots fundraising reach . a handful of big , progressive donors could help prop her up . " we have this mythology that you can go to @entity1 and @entity221 and knock a few doors and ultimate you too can be a serious presidential candidate , " @entity32 said . " maybe @entity270 could do that . i think that the schedule and political life has gotten to the point today where you are n't a serious candidate unless you go through the hoops of raising money and creating an organization . i think @entity67 probably comes the closest to it , but i do n't see who else . " @entity67 has done more than any @entity283 , including @entity9 , to help elect @entity1 @entity6 this year — and he has traveled far and wide to do the same in other states . though polling is of little consequence at this early stage , he remains stuck around one or two percent in hypothetical 2016 polls that match him up against @entity9 , @entity98 , @entity144 and others . still , @entity67 's @entity1 antennae is so heightened that during the @entity293 match - up between the @entity294 and the @entity295 earlier this month , he wandered over to a @entity297 tailgate and chatted up the revelers who had made the long trip from @entity1 to @entity68 . " all the @entity297 fans were quite impressed that here was the governor at this tailgate , and so was i , " said @entity300 , a @entity0 attorney and longtime @entity6 activist . " of course , we did n't talk about any of the future . but implicitly , people do n't spend time with @entity308 at a football game without a reason . " but @entity67 is still wrestling with the decision to mount a bid and — despite the conventional wisdom about his intentions — could very well sit the race out . what 's left , beyond a protest candidacy on the left mounted by @entity76 or someone else ? a long list of ambitious @entity6 eager to make a name for themselves in @entity1 , but unwilling to take the plunge against @entity9 . @entity101 's speech last weekend was a folksy and populist - tinged speech in which she declared that , " corporations are n't people ! people are people ! " it was warmly - received by @entity6 in the crowd who said they admired her family 's immigrant history . after the speech , she happily ticked through the similarities between her state and @entity1 . " iowans are our neighbors , " she said in an interview . " we have a lot of friends here back and forth between @entity102 and @entity1 . our states are pretty similar . we are both agriculture states . the farm bill and and the renewable fuel standard are really important . so it 's important to me to have allies in @entity1 like @entity216 has been , to get things done for the midwest . " the message was obvious : she would play well here in @entity1 . but she is not stepping into the arena so long as there 's a @entity9 in the other corner .
