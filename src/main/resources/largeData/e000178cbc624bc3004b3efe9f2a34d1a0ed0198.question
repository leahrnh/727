( @entity0 ) -- maybe it was the sound of the wind cutting through the wire . perhaps he caught a small vibration with his keen eyes . or it could have been a slight difference in the air 's smell . whatever it was , when @entity11 noticed that his @entity13 handler , @entity12 , was creeping down the wrong path in the @entity16 jungle , the @entity18 shepherd did something he 'd never done out in the field : he looked at @entity12 and barked , before taking a seat . " when he sat down , i knew there was a trip wire . i was one step away from it , " remembered @entity12 , who with his dog in 1969 was " walking point , " leading the way for a dozen soldiers . had the hidden explosive device been tripped , " it would have gotten half of us . " more than 40 years later , the gratitude and love @entity12 , 59 , feels for the dog he served with is as strong as ever . and it 's for this reason that @entity12 , president of the @entity38 , drove from his @entity40 , @entity41 , home to be in @entity42 this week . about 200 @entity16 dog handlers , who were trained to read and communicate with their canine partners , have gathered for a reunion . and on saturday they 'll join an expected several thousand others for the 10th anniversary rededication of the @entity50 at the @entity51 in @entity52 . during the @entity16 , more than 4,000 dogs served in various positions , said @entity55 , a military dog historian and author of " forever forward : k - 9 operations in @entity16 . " the scout dogs , such as @entity11 , walked with their handlers ahead of patrols -- making them the first target for ambushes or hidden explosives . there were also sentry dogs who guarded bases , tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground . the @entity79 placed a bounty on the dogs because they were so effective , @entity55 said . all told , he estimated the k - 9 teams averted more than 10,000 casualties . but at the end of the war , only about 200 dogs came home . the rest who had survived were either euthanized or turned over to the @entity90 -- left behind , a surplus of war . " they were treated as obsolete equipment . and if you were a handler , you could n't see them that way , " said @entity95 , 61 , who keeps a framed picture of himself and @entity97 , the black lab and shepherd mix he worked with , atop his desk in @entity101 , @entity102 . " when that 's your dog , that 's your dog . he sees you in danger , he 's going to respond . unconditional love -- it 's all for you . you ca n't help but love him . " on patrols , @entity95 used hand motions to speak to @entity97 . in turn , the animal spoke back through his movements . his ears would shoot up and turn in the direction of suspicious noise . the hair on his back would stand up if danger was close . if he wanted @entity124 to stop moving , he 'd look back at him . off - duty , @entity97 was playful . he liked to have his neck scratched and would roll around on the ground . the 110 - pound dog would cuddle up to @entity95 at night when they were out in the field , and he 'd eat out of his handler 's helmet . whenever @entity95 could , he 'd give his closest friend steak . the men who 'd walk behind the pair on missions were always different . but a scout handler and his dog were a constant , as the duo bounced between different assignments . when @entity141 , founder and former ceo of @entity144 pet foods , first learned about the dogs who 'd served and the fate of so many of them , he set out to teach others . based on about three years of research , he co-produced the documentary " @entity152 : @entity154 's @entity153 , " which first aired 11 years ago on the @entity155 . donations earned through this film allowed @entity141 , now president of the @entity50 , to commission three monuments , sculptures featuring a @entity18 shepherd and his handler . the first one was unveiled at the @entity164 in @entity52 . a second was installed at @entity166 , @entity102 . the third remains in storage , @entity141 said . the original goal to place it in @entity170 beside the @entity171 or at @entity172 in @entity173 remains an elusive dream . dogs have long served with the @entity154 military , said @entity55 , who also wrote " @entity152 : @entity177 . " during @entity180 , the dogs borrowed from the @entity181 and @entity182 worked as messengers and assisted the @entity184 by finding the wounded on battlefields , he said . the @entity154 k - 9 corps , @entity55 said , really began during @entity188 , when , among other tasks , thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines . back then , dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life , but that practice had changed by the time @entity154 forces entered @entity16 , @entity55 said . later , galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary , @entity16 dog handlers began to call for change . @entity201 , 60 , had n't spoken to another dog handler in 30 years when he showed up in @entity170 for his first reunion in 2000 . but as he talked to the 250 others in attendance , he realized the power of what they shared . " you go through the war , and you always remember the bond you have , the bond with the dog , " said @entity201 , whose dog @entity210 once yanked him up a bank from a rice paddy , out of the way of mortar fire . " on that first trip to the [ @entity171 ] wall , it was a reunion with the spirits of our dogs . " later , @entity201 , of @entity226 , @entity227 , would go on to write his own book and establish a traveling exhibit to pay tribute to the dogs who 'd served . @entity170 also took notice . in november 2000 , president @entity234 signed into law legislation that established a military working dog adoption program . now the dogs working in @entity238 and @entity239 will have a chance to find comfortable homes when they return from war . for @entity12 , of the @entity38 , this has been a blessing . he said leaving his partner sarge behind , all those decades ago , haunted him . " a lot of us [ handlers ] suffered @entity249 , " he said , referring to post-traumatic stress disorder . " it 's like leaving your kid back there . " but he now has @entity254 , the war dog he adopted from @entity256 in @entity257 , @entity41 . the @entity18 shepherd , who has hip problems , looks uncannily like @entity11 , he said , and having him around is a source of comfort . " i 'm taking care of an old vet , " @entity12 said , " and he 's taking care of me . "

several thousand people will gather saturday at a @entity50 in @placeholder
