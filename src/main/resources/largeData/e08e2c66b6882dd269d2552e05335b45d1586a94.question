it 's a tiny country of 5Â½ million people , but suddenly @entity2 feels like the most happening place on the planet . first , a @entity6 restaurant few people had heard of was voted best in the world -- and held on to the title for three years in a row . then @entity12 tv dramas " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " captured the imagination of a worldwide audience . and now designers @entity17 , @entity19 and a new generation coming up behind them are taking the international fashion scene by storm . " wonderful , wonderful @entity6 , " trilled @entity23 in his movie portrayal of @entity2 's famous fairytale author , @entity25 . and it is wonderful -- though there 's a lot more to the @entity12 capital than the beautiful little harbor surrounded by quaint townhouses that drew @entity25 to the city nearly 200 years ago . great experiences awaiting the curious traveler in @entity6 include : @entity35 tickled taste buds @entity37 , thrice voted world 's best restaurant , may be solidly booked for months , but there are other places to sample the new @entity43 cuisine this rustic eatery has inspired . the main principle is super-fresh @entity47 produce , inventively prepared . check out @entity48 , opened by an @entity50 chef , as well as @entity51 , @entity52 's , @entity53 and @entity54 . at the other end of the spectrum is traditional fare such as @entity58 ( delicious open sandwiches ) and crisp , buttery @entity12 pastries that put mass - produced imitations to shame . @entity62 is the pace for great @entity12 , as popular to start the day in @entity6 as a post-partying hot dog is to end the night . locals swear by @entity67 's @entity66 on bustling @entity68 , and get their dog slathered with remoulade sauce , raw and fried onions as well as ketchup . @entity74 's travel photo of the day a walk on the wild side many tourists do n't get far beyond picturesque @entity78 , where in summer you can barely move along the cobbled harbor lined with colorful old houses and restaurants . but thanks to " @entity13 , " bolder travelers are taking walking tours of the show 's @entity87 locations and exploring other edgy neighborhoods . once a red - light district , @entity87 has gentrified and is now the hippest residential area in town as well as a center of lively nightlife . head for the old meat - packing plant , now an art venue , and keep going till you hit the @entity99 -- the meat - packing district and now home to popular late - night hangouts such as @entity103 and the @entity104 . edgier yet is @entity105 , taken over by hippies 40 years ago and an official " free town " in the heart of the city . residents decorate their public buildings with amazing graffiti and have built spectacular family homes around a lake . despite the alternative activities taking place , tourists will come to no harm -- so long as they respect the strict no photography policy . the @entity121 outdoor bar puts on free weekend concerts may through august . @entity123 - inspiring @entity125 castles shopping till you drop @entity127 , @entity129 's longest pedestrian street , is lined with great boutiques -- check out @entity19 , whose clothes look more @entity132 than @entity12 , and the two big department stores , @entity134 and @entity135 . for more eclectic finds , stroll down @entity137 , just off the main tourist center of @entity78 , for antiques and unique housewares as well as fashion , and also check out @entity142 and @entity143 . @entity144 on @entity145 is considered one of the city 's finest vintage fashion emporia , while @entity149 is @entity6 's world - famous silversmith . a treat for your inner child given the affection for @entity25 's fairy tales , it 's no surprise @entity6 's most - visited attraction is the tiny statue of the @entity160 on the waterfront . and another is the nearly 170 - year - old @entity162 , a lovely amusement park that offers beautiful gardens , a pantomime theater and top restaurants as well as truly fearsome - looking fright rides . @entity6 also has a state - of - the - art zoo and clean outdoor swimming pools in the harbor with lifeguards and special sections for children . five places to find mermaids a feast for the eyes @entity12 design is world - famous -- think @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 -- and @entity6 has some spectacular buildings , too . the @entity184 is a striking 17th - century blend of red brick and curlicued green gables , while the @entity188 , designed for @entity190 airline by @entity180 in the late 1950s , has a lobby full of his iconic midcentury modern @entity194 and egg chairs . the @entity196 , next to the ugly @entity197 , made headlines when it opened in 1935 boasting @entity6 's first revolving doors . despite a faded exterior , it 's had updates to become a modern budget hotel . in a more traditional vein , the admiral hotel is a superb conversion of an 18th - century warehouse , with half its rooms overlooking the harbor . striking ultra-modern buildings include @entity6 's @entity212 conference center on the waterfront . a road trip to the @entity2 across the bridge the southern tip of @entity217 used to be @entity12 , and still looks it , so no wonder @entity6 locals scoot across the bridge connecting the two countries on weekends to eat in the province of @entity224 , known for its organic farms , pottery and fine restaurants as well as its wild beauty . the lively town of @entity230 , @entity217 , can be reached by train in half an hour , but it 's worth renting a car to explore both the area on the @entity12 side north of @entity6 , where the @entity236 is a main attraction , and the lovely coastal countryside of southern @entity217 . @entity224 will be familiar to fans of the @entity241 books and tv series , which are set there . one of @entity224 's newest attractions is the charming little rustic restaurant of @entity246 , tipped to succeed @entity37 as the next king of @entity43 cuisine . three top tips get an overview from a canal boat ; tours leave every hour from @entity78 and provide an excellent opportunity to see @entity6 from the water . pay extreme care when getting out of a taxi ; @entity6 roads have two curbs , and only one of them is designed for pedestrians . the curb where taxis pull up separates vehicles from a busy cycle path -- not from the sidewalk . join @entity6 's hordes of cyclists by getting on a free city bike . you 'll require a 20 @entity12 kroner coin -- around $ 3 -- as refundable deposit , and must remember not to cycle after dark or in the city 's parks . for information , check out www.visitcopenhagen.com .
