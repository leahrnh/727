( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's foreign policy has gone into a tailspin . almost every major initiative from the @entity6 administration has run into sharp , sometimes embarrassing , reverses . the @entity2 looks weak and confused on the global stage . this might come as happy news to some opponents of the administration who enjoy seeing @entity6 fail , but it should n't . @entity2 's failure in international strategy is a disaster - in - the - making for its allies and for the people who see the @entity2 model of liberal democracy as one worth emulating in their own nations . there is no question that @entity6 was dealt a difficult hand . he came to office after @entity2 's international standing was battered by the unpopular @entity28 war launched by @entity29 . since then , countless events outside of @entity32 's control have presented the @entity33 with options ranging in many cases from bad to worse , and problems that had no good solution . still , trying to count the ways in which foreign policy has gone badly for @entity6 makes for a stunningly long list . relations with @entity42 have fallen off a cliff , making the theatrical " reset " of 2009 look , frankly , cringe - worthy . no , it 's not all @entity6 's fault . @entity48 has sought to belittle the @entity2 and humiliate @entity6 personally , a man he reportedly despises , as part of his campaign to build up his authoritarian rule at home . @entity6 just canceled a summit meeting after @entity48 -- incredibly , posing as the great defender of freedom -- granted asylum to @entity59 leaker @entity58 despite the very public pleas from @entity32 , which only made the @entity2 look more powerless . you might confuse the times with the old @entity63 days , but back then the @entity2 looked mighty -- one of two awe - inspiring superpowers . the @entity2 does n't exactly inspire awe anymore . @entity6 dramatically warned @entity68 dictator @entity67 , as he slaughtered his people by the thousands , that if he used chemical or biological weapons , he would cross a " red line . " the line was crossed and not much happened . @entity68 is crumbling , self - destructing in a civil war that i , for one , believe could have turned out quite differently if @entity32 had offered material and diplomatic support for moderates in the opposition . fears that the opposition would be dominated by extremists became a self - fulfilling prophecy . @entity68 's war has sucked in @entity89 's @entity88 - backed @entity87 militia , taking @entity89 to the edge of disaster and making @entity88 a major player in a war for the survival of the @entity96 axis -- @entity88 - @entity68 - @entity87 -- while the @entity2 , to all appearances , stands helplessly on the sidelines . but it is @entity100 where @entity2 's foreign policy fiasco is most visible . it was in @entity103 in 2009 , where the newly elected @entity6 , still reflecting the glow of sky - high expectations , launched his campaign to repair relations with the so - called " @entity110 . " his landmark " @entity113 " speech in @entity100 was cited by the committee that awarded @entity6 the @entity115 . nobody knew what would happen in @entity103 's @entity118 a few years later . but today , the same people who yearned for democracy despise @entity32 . when @entity100 elected a @entity122 president , @entity32 tried to act respectfully , but it showed a degree of deference to the @entity122 that ignored the ways in which the group violated not only @entity100 ' but @entity2 's own standards of decency and rule of law . as tensions in @entity100 grow between islamists on one side and the military and anti-islamists on the other , there is one sentiment shared by all : both sides feel betrayed by @entity32 . @entity100 's most powerful man , gen. @entity140 , said , " you [ the @entity2 ] left the @entity100 ; you turned your back on the @entity100 , and they wo n't forget that . " the awkward dance around whether to call @entity100 's overthrow of president @entity146 a coup made @entity32 look dishonest and incompetent , especially when secretary of state @entity148 accidentally went off script during an interview in @entity151 , saying the military was " restoring democracy . " just as the @entity155 uprisings were unfolding , the @entity2 announced a major new policy , the " pivot " to @entity161 , with new attention to @entity159 's rising power . but the pivot proved premature . the @entity162 demanded @entity2 attention with increasing urgency . then there 's @entity166 , all but given up for dead , now apparently resurrected . more than a dozen @entity2 embassies stand shuttered across the @entity162 and @entity170 , the world 's last remaining superpower symbolically cowering behind locked gates . the scare came from what could be counted as a victory for @entity2 intelligence , reportedly the result of communications surveillance . and yet , one wonders whether telling the world that the @entity2 successfully listened in on @entity166 's leaders is n't an absurd mistake . but @entity32 is on the defensive , trying to explain to the world that the surveillance is still necessary . everyone , it seems , is angry at the @entity2 after @entity58 's revelations of @entity59 spying . even @entity187 , one of @entity2 's closest friends , can not hide its irritation . @entity191 is furious after the presidential plane was forced to land on suspicions that @entity58 was aboard . @entity2 's diplomatic disaster is the result of ham - handed efforts to please all sides , compounded by a failure to explain @entity2 's position in a coherent way . in fact , there is no driving idea behind the country 's foreign policy . what does @entity2 stand for in the world today , can anyone answer that question ? the problem , ironically , is tailor - made for none other than president @entity6 . although there is no denying that he bears the brunt of the responsibility for the problem , he is someone who has shown a talent for distilling overarching ideas from competing narratives . it is time for a real reset , for a pivot . it is time for @entity6 to spend some time thinking about what @entity2 stands for , what its goals are and then explain it in a clear and credible way . even if we disagree with his conclusions , at least there will be a @entity231 guiding his policies . @entity6 's supporters and his critics should hope he can pull @entity2 forward . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .

@entity242 : @entity6 should spend some time thinking about what @placeholder really stands for
