 the @entity9 picked all three pitchers in their first time on the ballot 
 @entity7 , who played 20 years with the @entity13 as a catcher , second baseman and outfielder , made it in on his third try after falling a few votes shy last year

 dubbed the " @entity4 , " he broke through with the @entity23 and went on to star for the @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 -- racking up 4,875 strikeouts , five @entity29 awards and the 2001 @entity31 honor in the process 
 @entity5 got his start in @entity34 , made a name for himself with the @entity36 and became a @entity38 winner with the @entity39 before finishing off his career with the @entity41 and @entity42 
 the charismatic righty from the @entity44 posted 219 wins and 100 losses , along with 3,154 strikeouts , over his career 
 while @entity4 and @entity5 were both starting pitchers , @entity6 was that and more 
 the eight - time all - star -- who spent almost his entire career with the @entity53 -- had 24 wins as a starter in 1996 , but became a relief pitcher five years later , including a remarkable 55 saves in 2002
