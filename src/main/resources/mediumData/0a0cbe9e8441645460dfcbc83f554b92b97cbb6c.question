@entity0 was yesterday accused of providing a ‘ refuelling stop ’ for illegal immigrants trying to get to @entity3 with plans for a new @entity6 - style refugee camp . mps said proposals for housing 400 people near @entity11 would act as a magnet , encouraging more desperate people to attempt the perilous journey to the @entity3 . they were also furious at plans to set up ‘ welcome centres ’ providing help and advice to people seeking to reach @entity3 ’s shores . these may be used to help migrants make applications for asylum in @entity3 . scroll down for video the mayor of @entity11 today called for the building of a permanent centre for thousands of illegal migrants making their way to @entity3 the row began after @entity11 mayor @entity31 announced plans for a state - funded camp , providing shelter , food and washing facilities , for thousands of migrants who pass through the port . in words which have already raised the spectre of a new @entity6 , she said that allowing them all to sleep rough in her town was ' unsustainable . ' mayor @entity31 said : ‘ @entity11 is today under an unbearable strain from the highest number of migrants we have ever known . ‘ in the face of this new situation we can not stay with our arms folded . i am going to propose a solution to the government – the creation of a [ migrant ] centre away from local residents . ‘ it is the only way to rid the town of this huge migrant presence , which is as unbearable for local people as it is for the migrants . ’ madame @entity31 will submit her proposal to @entity0 interior minister @entity65 at a meeting on september 2 . in words which have already raised the spectre of a new @entity6 , ( pictured in 2001 ) @entity31 said that allowing them all to sleep rough in her town was ' unsustainable ' four potential sites for the centre have been identified outside @entity11 but their locations have been kept secret for fear of a public outcry . it is said the centre will be ' far from the town , because if it is close to local residents it becomes too tense ' . @entity31 estimated it would ' remove 80 per cent ' of those sleeping rough , and reassure @entity11 residents they were entitled to ' a bit of peace ' the mayor claims she does not want ‘ a new @entity6 ’ – the name of the notorious @entity91 centre closed in 2002 that was used by 60,000 people as a springboard for illegal entry to @entity3 . but , faced with an influx of more migrants , ms @entity31 told the @entity96 du @entity95 newspaper : ' i would accept the construction of this centre if the state agrees to manage it . ' she estimated it would ' remove 80 per cent ' of those sleeping rough , and reassure @entity11 residents that they were entitled to ' a bit of peace ' . but last night critics said her plan to open a dedicated camp would encourage huge numbers to flock to the @entity110 . conservative mp for @entity113 @entity112 said : ‘ it ’s completely unacceptable at every level for the @entity0 authorities to provide a refuelling stop for illegal immigrants trying to get to @entity3 . this needs to be raised urgently at the highest level with the @entity0 government . ‘ we need to take urgent steps to tighten our border controls at @entity125 and elsewhere to ensure that this new wave of uncontrolled immigration does not come to @entity3 . ‘ it ’s quite clear that these people are not claiming asylum in @entity0 . they are passing through @entity0 and only claiming asylum once they arrive in the @entity3 . ‘ it ’s completely unacceptable for migrants to pass through many other safe countries before claiming asylum in the @entity3 . ’ the situation has deteriorated in @entity11 this year because of a new wave of immigrants from @entity139 and @entity140 . tens of thousands have crossed the @entity143 after the collapse of @entity145 . up to 1,500 migrants are camping out or living in squats run by anarchists in @entity11 . hundreds more are living in makeshift shelters and tents in woods and sand dunes along @entity0 ’s north coast . @entity11 ’ deputy mayor @entity155 has warned that the migrant population there will rise to up to 5,000 by the end of the year if the situation does not change . around 1200 migrants - mainly @entity139 , @entity160 and @entity161 - are currently squatting in disused buildings , or living in temporary camps - ones which the @entity0 regularly raze ( file photo ) around 1200 migrants - mainly @entity139 , @entity160 and @entity161 - are currently squatting in disused buildings , or living in temporary camps - ones which the @entity0 regularly raze . violent clashes between rival ethnic groups armed with knives and metal bars broke out two weeks ago as they fought for the best sites from which to clamber on @entity3 - bound lorries . outnumbered riot police have been unable to control the situation . there have also been disturbances involving people smugglers who charge the equivalent of around £ 1000 for a passage across the @entity178 in a lorry or car . last night immigration minister @entity181 declined to comment directly on plans for a ‘ new @entity6 ’ in @entity11 . in a statement he said : ‘ security at the @entity3 border is our priority and we will continue to strengthen it to stop those who have no right to enter the @entity3 . ‘ we are taking action at a national and international level to tackle illegal immigration . ’ humanitarian workers in @entity11 welcomed the idea of the camp . one , @entity197 , said : ' it 's a change of position , because until now she was blocking the suggestion of a shelter and denouncing the squats . ' it 's positive to reopen the debate , but a centre for 400 people is not enough . we need a long - term solution , and a better idea would be smaller houses dotted around the centre - rather than a ghetto . @entity6 was a magnet for immigrants before its closure . it mushroomed from a centre for 400 migrants into a mass shelter for 1200 people , attracting people smugglers and other criminals to do business around it . it was also a place where riots regularly broke out . it was shut in 2002 by the then interior minister , @entity228 , as part of an agreement which saw @entity3 accepting many of those migrants living in it .

@placeholder said allowing them to sleep rough was ' unsustainable '
