( @entity0 ) -- it 's that time of year when colleges around the country show off the people who will offer the last lesson to soon - to - be graduates : the commencement speakers 
 this year , some universities drew on famous alumni : the @entity10 featured 1992 @entity12 graduate @entity11 , the @entity13 - winning screenwriter and director of @entity16 's hit film " @entity17 
 " @entity18 , creator of " @entity19 " and " scandal , " told graduates of her alma mater , @entity22 , that it 's impossible to do it all , but it 's still worth doing as much as they can 
 " volunteer some hours 
 focus on something outside yourself 
 devote a slice of your energies towards making the world suck less every week , " @entity18 said 
 " some people suggest doing this will increase your sense of well - being 
 some say it 's good karma 
 i say that it will allow you to remember that , whether you are a legacy or the first in your family to go to college , the air you are breathing right now is rare air 
 appreciate it 
 " other schools competed for high - profile speakers like president @entity48 , who spoke at @entity49 in june after receiving 10,000 postcards from the community asking him to attend 
 first lady @entity52 spoke at @entity53 in @entity54 , as well as a high school senior recognition ceremony in @entity56 , @entity57 , and a college access program in @entity59 
 president @entity48 used part of his speech at @entity49 to address climate change , calling lawmakers and pundits who deny manmade climate change a " fairly serious threat to everybody 's future 
 " " @entity70 wo n't always be flashy 
 it will be measured in disasters averted , and lives saved , and a planet preserved -- and days just like this one , 20 years from now , and 50 years from now , and 100 years from now , " he said 
 " but can you imagine a more worthy goal -- a more worthy legacy -- than protecting the world we leave to our children ? " the gallery above shows some high - profile commencement speakers that grads are hearing from this spring
