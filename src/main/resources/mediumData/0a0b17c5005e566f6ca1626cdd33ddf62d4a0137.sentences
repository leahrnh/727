 @entity2 was part of the first group of swimmers who swam to a buoy a short distance out 
 @entity17 and his older brother @entity45 did the long distance swim as well

 to participate , you must brave the ocean in your regular bathing suit 
 there were about 100 participants 
 @entity2 was quick to get her son @entity30 a towel after the swim 
 the @entity17 's are a close family , and @entity2 seems to get along with everyone , even her step - son @entity17 so while @entity84 blasts her as a ' home wrecker ' in the new episode of @entity87 , it seems like all these years later it 's all good 
 @entity2 joined the @entity89 of @entity91 cast in its current season along with @entity93 
 in a recent interview on @entity95 ! the @entity89 showed clips from the reality show including the scene where @entity84 throws a glass of wine at @entity101 and calls her a home wrecker 
 @entity103 asked @entity22 why @entity84 would call her that 
 @entity2 was having a pretty good hair day as she prepared to take the plunge @entity2 removed her sweats before the event better out than in : it was warmer on dry land than in the 56 degree ocean original : @entity18 ( above ) followed in his father 's footsteps to take part in the challenge and now his son and @entity2 are doing the same the season 5 cast of @entity87 : from left to right , @entity118 , @entity84 , @entity2 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity93 , @entity121 award : @entity2 and husband @entity17 celebrate her @entity8 last year ' oh , i do n't know , ' she responded 
 @entity125 ex-husband is @entity126 , who famously left her for country singer @entity127 , and she particularly sensitive on the subject 
 apparently @entity17 was married was when he met @entity2 
 @entity103 said @entity84 ' seems to be the villain of the show â€“ the pot - stirrer , ' to which @entity22 replied : ' yeah , that seems to be her thing 
 '
