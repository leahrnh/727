@entity0 has come under fire for ' glorifying shoplifters and drug addicts ' in the latest episode of its controversial programme @entity7 
 the second series of the show - which has been labelled ' poverty porn ' by critics - is set in one of @entity14 's most deprived areas , @entity15 in @entity16 , once the largest fishing port in the world 
 but since the collapse of the industry , the area has been plunged into unemployment , and the documentary claims to follow the lives of fishermen out of work after a lifetime at sea , and people doing ' whatever they can to make ends meet ' 
 last night 's episode , however , sparked fury with viewers after it showed a jobless drug - addicted couple shoplifting and trying to sell their furniture after they discovered their benefits would not be paid because they missed an appointment at the @entity40 
 @entity0 has come under fire for glorifying ' shoplifters and drug addicts ' in the latest episode of its controversial series @entity7 
 last night 's episode saw one contributor stealing flowers for a funeral to order meanwhile , her boyfriend @entity49 was shown donning a high - vis jacket and daubing himself with paint in order to convince shop staff he had just finished work , before heading off out , apprently to shoplift left with just ' six potato croquettes and two tins of soup in the cupboards ' they instead steal for food and to feed their drug habit 
 but @entity64 users were quick to point out that the contributors were able to afford cans of alcohol and can be seen smoking on camera 
 ' will ' was seen donning a high - vis jacket and daubing himself with paint in order to convince people he had just finished work , before heading off out - apparently to shoplift 
 his girlfriend is seen returning home laden with flowers after stealing them to order for a funeral 
 will told film crews : ' i walk in , high - vis , paint all over me , maybe some on my face , and on me hands and trackies , they think ' he 's a worker - he 's not a shoplifter 
 ' he adds : ' it 's all about what 's up here ' , before tapping his head 
 @entity92 tweeted : ' absolute f * * * ing idiots just casually stealing and discussing it on tv 
 @entity96 
 # @entity7 @ @entity97 ( sic ) @entity98 added : ' @entity99 called ' thick ' going on tv & exposing yourself as a shoplifter ! ! ? please do write from prison & let us know how that went 4 u # skint ' ( sic ) @entity107 added : ' @entity108 stereotyping poverty porn tv with repeated narrow focussed images on loop 
 # @entity112 - this is wrong # grimsby ' the show has already faced controversy over one of its contributors - a woman called @entity119 - who claims to have witnessed domestic violence as a child , and worked as a prostitute 
 her relatives said they asked the broadcaster to edit her contribution because of the possible impact the ' poverty porn ' television could have on her children , the @entity123 reports 
 @entity64 users were quick to point out that the show contributors were able to afford cans of alcohol and can be seen smoking on camera others said the programme left them feeling ' heartbroken ' and more fortunate about their own situation mp @entity140 , the mp for the constituency of @entity16 , has also criticised @entity0 for commissioning a second series of the the programme , accusing show - makers of ' poverty tourism ' after the success of controversial but popular @entity147 
 he accused the shows of ' concentrating hatred on the least well - educated ' and the ' most deprived ' 
 the @entity151 mp told @entity153 magazine : ' @entity0 has discovered that poverty tourism does more for ratings than celebrity culture , missions to explain or any highfalutin attempts to hold government to account , ' he added 
 ' kicking people when they 're down ( and gullible ) is so much easier and less expensive than intelligent programming 
 ' victims do n't sue , and when do - gooders complain , they can always be accused of wanting to censor serious seekers after truth 
 so we get a proliferation of misery telly and programmes like @entity147 , @entity171 and @entity172 
 ' the show also follows the touching story of former trawlerman @entity175 , his partner @entity176 and their family who can be seen fundraising for a local hospice in the show it also features rev @entity181 , who has run the @entity183 youth project on the @entity15 estate in @entity16 since 1972 , and has defended the documentary however , rev @entity181 , who features in the series and has run the @entity183 youth project on the @entity15 estate in @entity16 since 1972 , defended the documentary 
 he told @entity187 : ' we were very happy with the programme and the way we were portrayed in it 
 we looked at it very carefully before we decided to take part 
 ' he described the ' poverty porn ' label as ' nonsense ' and denied that the programme could be seen as entertainment at other people 's expense 
 ' we have 45 per cent child poverty , 30 per cent pensioner poverty and 44 per cent lone families 
 it 's appalling the way these people have been treated â€“ there are more and more burdens on the community and they are reaching breaking point 
 ' @entity0 insisted the programme highlights the reality of deprivation for many people in the @entity14 , and gives a voice to those suffering the impact of long - term unemployment 
 a @entity0 spokesman said : ' in the last half century , @entity16 has faced the almost complete loss of its fishing industry on which the town depended 
 ' nowhere has this loss been more harshly felt than in parts of the @entity15 
 this sympathetic observational documentary , filmed over a year , allows individuals and families to tell their stories about living in one of @entity14 's most deprived areas and suffering the devastating effect of deindustrialisation
