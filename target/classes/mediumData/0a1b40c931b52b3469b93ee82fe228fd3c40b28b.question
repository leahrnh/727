( @entity0 ) -- the internet connection in @entity2 was cut friday , limiting the free flow of information the nation 's citizens were sharing with the world depicting the violent crackdown on monks and other peaceful demonstrators . @entity11 runs his @entity2 blog out of his @entity14 apartment and says he 's trying to stop the violence . @entity2 - based blogs went dark suddenly . but @entity14 - based blogger @entity11 -- who has been one of the most prominent bloggers posting information about the violence -- has vowed to keep up the fight , saying where " there is a will , there is a way . " " i sadly announce that the @entity2 military junta has cut off the internet connection throughout the country , " he said on his blog friday . " i , therefore , would not be able to feed in pictures of the brutality by the brutal @entity2 military junta . " @entity11 is a 28 - year - old who left @entity2 , once known as @entity2 , seven years ago to study in @entity33 . watch a blogger 's fight for @entity2 » he told @entity0 a day earlier that he has as many as 40 people in @entity2 sending him photos or calling him with information . they often take the photos from windows from their homes , he said . @entity2 's military junta has forbidden such images , and anyone who sends them is risking their lives . " if they get caught , you will never know their future . maybe just disappear or maybe life in prison or maybe dead , " he told @entity0 . why would they take such risks ? " they thought that this is their duty for the country , " he said . " that 's why they are doing it . it 's like a mission . " even with friday 's action by the government , he said he will continue to do all he can to get images of what 's happening out for the world to see . " i will also try my best to feed in their demonic appetite of fear and paranoia by posting any pictures that i receive through other means , " he said on his blog . " i will continue to live with the motto that ' if there is a will there is a way . ' " with few @entity84 journalists allowed in @entity2 , his blog has become one of the main information outlets . more than 170,000 people from 175 countries have gone to the blog , according to a counter on the page . on friday , shots rang out in the streets of @entity2 's biggest city of @entity95 , marking the third straight day of violence at the hands of the ruling military junta to suppress citizen protests . see photos of the protests » one diplomat told @entity0 that a @entity84 witness had reported seeing about 35 bodies lying in rows on a street near @entity107 , with civilians praying over them . @entity0 could not independently confirm the report , and it was not known if the bodies were from friday or the result of earlier violence . according to @entity115 , @entity114 prime minister @entity113 said friday he believes the loss of life in @entity2 has been " far greater " than is being reported . in a country where @entity122 monks are revered , the violence against them could stir even more outrage among the people of @entity2 . " now , there is blood shed on the monastery , " @entity11 said . the @entity128 has also spawned other @entity2 pages . on the popular online community of @entity132 , several @entity2 support pages were set up with links keeping a close eye on the latest developments . one letter floating around the internet from a group calling itself the " @entity139 of @entity140 " called on people abroad to stage protests . " we call on you to take action , to take the lead , and to show solidarity with our fellow countrymen back home , " it said . " the streets of @entity95 bleed red , and it will all be in vain if we do not act and mobilize for change . " other people used technology as simple as the cell phone as a means to get the word out on what was happening . " we did n't do any terrorism , but they sharp - shoot us , " one woman said by phone inside @entity2 thursday . " i just want to say we have no weapons and no rights . " she added , " who can help us ? " the last time the nation saw such widespread protests was in 1988 , when today 's instantaneous means of communication did not exist . the government used brutal force to quash that democratic uprising , with few people seeing what happened . view a timeline of events there » today 's technology allows anyone with the means to capture what is happening . despite the cutting of the internet inside the country , people can still take pictures and videos with cell phones and send them to the outside world . " they are ready to die for that , " @entity192 with @entity193 said on thursday . " i spoke with a @entity2 journalist this morning in @entity95 and he told me that now i do n't care about anything . i 'm ready to be in jail . i 'm ready to die for that . " @entity199 , a 25 - year - old student from a university in @entity201 , @entity202 , sent @entity0 video of saffron - robed monks carrying out a peaceful protest earlier this week in @entity95 , once known as @entity95 . the video shows thousands of monks and civilians walking together and chanting . he said he felt compelled to share the video because people " should know what is happening in a country like @entity2 . " " in a world where democracy is considered the better or perhaps the best political system , there is huge global support for a people who dare to openly challenge a military dictatorship and call for democracy , " @entity199 said . " i think it 's good for the world to see . " @entity11 agrees , saying he 's just trying to stop the killing in his homeland . " if i can publish these kind of [ photos ] and this kind of news to the world , so maybe they may stop a little bit . " e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity232 contributed to this report .
